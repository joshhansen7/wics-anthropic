# Pope Francis

**Pope Francis** (Latin: *Franciscus*; Spanish: *Francisco*; born **Jorge Mario Bergoglio**, 17 December 1936 – 21 April 2025) was the 266th [pope](/article/en/Pope) of the [Catholic Church](/article/en/Catholic_Church) and [sovereign](/article/en/Sovereignty) of [Vatican City](/article/en/Vatican_City) from 13 March 2013 until his death on 21 April 2025.

Born and raised in [Buenos Aires](/article/en/Buenos_Aires), [Argentina](/article/en/Argentina), to a family of [Italian](/article/en/Italy) origin, Bergoglio was the first pope from the [Americas](/article/en/Americas), the [Southern Hemisphere](/article/en/Southern_Hemisphere), and the [Society of Jesus](/article/en/Society_of_Jesus) (Jesuits). He was also the first pope not born in [Europe](/article/en/Europe) since [Pope Gregory III](/article/en/Pope_Gregory_III) (died 741), over 1,200 years earlier. He chose the [papal name](/article/en/Papal_name) Francis in honor of [Saint Francis of Assisi](/article/en/Francis_of_Assisi), reflecting his concern for the poor and emphasis on mercy as a central theme of his pontificate.

Throughout his papacy, Francis was noted for his humility, international visibility, commitment to [interreligious dialogue](/article/en/Interfaith_dialogue), and particular concern for the poor, migrants, and refugees. He made women and laypeople full members of [dicasteries](/article/en/Dicastery) in the [Roman Curia](/article/en/Roman_Curia), expanded the [College of Cardinals](/article/en/College_of_Cardinals) to be more geographically representative, and convened the [Synod on Synodality](/article/en/Synod_on_Synodality), which was described as the culmination of his papacy. He initiated significant reforms in Vatican finances, addressed the [clergy sexual abuse crisis](/article/en/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_scandal), and made action on [climate change](/article/en/Climate_change) a leading focus through his encyclical [*Laudato Si'*](/article/en/Laudato_Si).

## Early Life and Formation

### Childhood and Family Background

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936 in [Flores](/article/en/Flores,_Buenos_Aires), a neighborhood of [Buenos Aires](/article/en/Buenos_Aires), to Mario José Bergoglio (1908–1961) and Regina María Sívori (1911–1981). He was the eldest of five children: Oscar Adrián (1938–1997), Marta Regina (1940–2007), Alberto Horacio (1942–2010), and María Elena (born 1948), his only surviving sibling. His father was an accountant and railroad worker from [Piedmont](/article/en/Piedmont) in northern [Italy](/article/en/Italy), while his mother was born in Buenos Aires to parents of [Piedmontese](/article/en/Piedmont) and [Ligurian](/article/en/Liguria) origin.

Mario Bergoglio had emigrated from Italy in 1929 to escape the [fascism](/article/en/Fascism) of [Benito Mussolini](/article/en/Benito_Mussolini). According to María Elena Bergoglio, the family's decision was not motivated primarily by economic circumstances but by the desire to escape political repression. The family was deeply Catholic and rooted in both Italian and Argentine traditions. During his childhood, Jorge was influenced by his grandmother Rosa Vasallo, whom he later acknowledged as "the woman who had the greatest influence" on his life.

In his youth, Bergoglio demonstrated intellectual curiosity and cultural interests. He was an avid reader of classical literature, particularly admiring Argentine writers [Jorge Luis Borges](/article/en/Jorge_Luis_Borges) and [Fyodor Dostoevsky](/article/en/Fyodor_Dostoevsky). He enjoyed [tango](/article/en/Tango_music) dancing, classical music, and cinema. From childhood, he was a passionate supporter of the [San Lorenzo de Almagro](/article/en/San_Lorenzo_de_Almagro) football club, a connection that would remain throughout his life.

### Education and Early Career

Bergoglio received his primary education at the [Salesian](/article/en/Salesian_School) school Wilfrid Barón de los Santos Ángeles in [Ramos Mejía](/article/en/Ramos_Mejía), Buenos Aires Province. He subsequently attended the technical secondary school Escuela Técnica Industrial Nº 27 Hipólito Yrigoyen, from which he graduated with a diploma as a chemical technician. For several years, he worked at the Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory in the food control section under the supervision of Esther Ballestrino, a woman who would profoundly influence his social consciousness. Before his religious vocation led him to the priesthood, he also worked as a bouncer and janitor.

At age 21, Bergoglio experienced a severe health crisis. Following a serious respiratory infection and the discovery of three cysts, he underwent a pulmonary lobectomy in which the upper lobe of his right lung was removed. Though this left him with reduced respiratory reserve, he reported no significant limitations on his health or activities for the remainder of his life. This early brush with mortality deepened his spiritual reflection.

### Religious Vocation

On the way to a traditional spring celebration in 1957, the 20-year-old Bergoglio entered a church to make confession and experienced a profound spiritual moment. He was moved by a priest's demeanor and began serious consideration of religious life. After considerable prayer and reflection, he made his decision to pursue the priesthood.

On 11 March 1958, Bergoglio entered the novitiate of the [Society of Jesus](/article/en/Society_of_Jesus) (Jesuits). Between 1958 and 1960, he completed his junior studies at the Jesuit school in [Santiago, Chile](/article/en/Santiago,_Chile). On 12 March 1960, after three years of formation, he officially became a Jesuit, making the religious profession of initial, perpetual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. That same year, he obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio Máximo de San José in Buenos Aires.

From 1964 to 1965, Bergoglio taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción in [Santa Fe](/article/en/Santa_Fe,_Argentina). In 1966, he taught the same subjects at Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires. Beginning in 1967, he pursued theological studies at the Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel.

On 13 December 1969, Bergoglio was ordained as a priest by [Archbishop](/article/en/Archbishop) Ramón José Castellano in [Córdoba](/article/en/Córdoba,_Argentina). He served as master of novices and professor of theology for the Jesuit order. Between 1970 and 1971, he completed his tertianship (final spiritual formation) at [Alcalá de Henares](/article/en/Alcalá_de_Henares), Spain. On 22 April 1973, he professed his final vows as a Jesuit, including the fourth vow of special obedience to [papal](/article/en/Papacy) missioning.

## Jesuit Leadership and Argentine Ministry (1973–1992)

### Provincial Superior (1973–1979)

In July 1973, at age 36, Bergoglio was named provincial superior of the [Society of Jesus](/article/en/Society_of_Jesus) in [Argentina](/article/en/Argentina) for a six-year term ending in 1979. During this period, he held significant responsibility for the Jesuit community during the tumultuous years leading to and including the beginning of [Argentina's military dictatorship](/article/en/Dirty_War).

In 1973, during a pilgrimage to [Jerusalem](/article/en/Jerusalem), his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the [Yom Kippur War](/article/en/Yom_Kippur_War). During his tenure as provincial, Bergoglio faced complex challenges regarding the [liberation theology](/article/en/Liberation_theology) movement that was strong among some Latin American Jesuits. While sympathetic to concerns for the poor and marginalized, Bergoglio adopted a more cautious approach than some of his brother Jesuits, emphasizing direct pastoral work and popular religiosity over what he viewed as overly politicized or Marxist-influenced approaches to social change. This nuanced position would later become a subject of historical debate.

### The Dirty War Period (1976–1983)

During [Argentina's military dictatorship](/article/en/Dirty_War) (1976–1983), as provincial superior and later in other roles, Bergoglio worked to protect members of the Jesuit community from state repression. The regime targeted religious figures associated with [liberation theology](/article/en/Liberation_theology) and social activism, subjecting many to torture, disappearance, and death.

The most controversial episode involves the 1976 kidnapping of two Jesuit priests under Bergoglio's command: [Orlando Yorio](/article/en/Orlando_Yorio) and [Francisco Jalics](/article/en/Francisco_Jalics). Both priests worked in [villas miseria](/article/en/Villa_miseria) (shantytown slums) engaged in social work. They were abducted by members of the [Argentine Navy](/article/en/Argentine_Navy) on 23 May 1976, tortured at the notorious [ESMA](/article/en/ESMA) detention center, and released alive after five months, though traumatized and physically damaged.

The historical record on Bergoglio's role remains contested:

**Critical allegations:** In a 2005 complaint filed by human rights lawyer Myriam Bregman, Bergoglio was accused of complicity or insufficient protection. Journalist [Horacio Verbitsky](/article/en/Horacio_Verbitsky)'s 2005 book *The Silence* suggested Bergoglio may have compromised the priests' safety. One brother of the kidnapped Yorio made public accusations.

**Exculpatory evidence:** Both surviving priests offered clarifications. In 1999, Yorio acknowledged his initial suspicions were unfounded. More significantly, on 14 March 2013 (the day after Bergoglio's papal election), Jalics issued a statement: "It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio... Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio."

In testimony before [Federal Oral Court No. 5](/article/en/Federal_Oral_Court) in 2011, and in interviews with authorized biographer [Sergio Rubin](/article/en/Sergio_Rubin), Bergoglio stated he had worked behind the scenes for the priests' release, meeting privately with dictator [Jorge Rafael Videla](/article/en/Jorge_Rafael_Videla) and [Eduardo Massera](/article/en/Eduardo_Massera) to secure their liberation. He also reported sheltering persecuted individuals on church property and once providing his own identity documents to a man resembling him so he could flee Argentina.

**Judicial determination:** The 2011 Federal Oral Court verdict ruled that ecclesiastical authorities' efforts persuaded the regime to release the kidnapped priests. Bergoglio was not charged with any crime. Former prosecutor Julio César Strassera, who led the Trial of the Juntas prosecuting military officials, stated it was "a rascality" to link Bergoglio with the dictatorship: "In the entire trial there was not a single mention of Bergoglio."

**Human rights testimony:** Argentine [Nobel Peace Prize](/article/en/Nobel_Peace_Prize) laureate [Adolfo Pérez Esquivel](/article/en/Adolfo_Pérez_Esquivel) stated Bergoglio "never collaborated with the dictatorship" though he "perhaps lacked the courage of other priests." Judge [Ricardo Lorenzetti](/article/en/Ricardo_Lorenzetti), president of Argentina's Supreme Court, called Bergoglio "completely innocent" of accusations. Graciela Fernández Meijide of the human rights organization APDH stated: "Bergoglio was never mentioned" as an instigator during years of receiving testimony about dictatorship crimes.

Journalist [Nello Scavo](/article/en/Nello_Scavo) documented in *Bergoglio's List* testimony from numerous individuals—priests, laypeople, dissidents, and intellectuals—who claimed Bergoglio helped them escape the dictatorship through a clandestine network he organized. In 2016, Pope Francis declassified Vatican archives related to the Argentine dictatorship, allowing researchers access to relevant documents.

### Rector of San Miguel (1980–1986)

After his term as provincial ended in 1979, Bergoglio was appointed rector of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel, a position he held from 1980 to 1986. Before assuming this role, he spent the first three months of 1980 in [Ireland](/article/en/Ireland) at the [Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy](/article/en/Milltown_Institute) in [Dublin](/article/en/Dublin) to improve his English.

As rector, Bergoglio's emphasis on pastoral work and popular religiosity created tensions with Jesuit leadership, which at that time was emphasizing structural social change and social justice in ways more aligned with liberation theology. In 1986, at the discretion of [Jesuit superior-general Peter Hans Kolvenbach](/article/en/Peter_Hans_Kolvenbach), Bergoglio was replaced by someone considered more aligned with contemporary Jesuit priorities. This decision was interpreted by some as a form of ecclesial punishment, though Bergoglio himself described the period that followed as one of "inner purification."

Following his removal as rector, Bergoglio spent several months at the [Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology](/article/en/Sankt_Georgen) in [Frankfurt](/article/en/Frankfurt), Germany, where he considered doctoral dissertation topics, particularly the work of theologian [Romano Guardini](/article/en/Romano_Guardini), specifically his study of "Contrast."

### Return to Argentina and Córdoba (1986–1992)

Bergoglio ultimately did not complete a doctoral degree and returned to Argentina earlier than expected. He was assigned as confessor and spiritual director to the Jesuit community in [Córdoba](/article/en/Córdoba,_Argentina), where he served for approximately six years. During this period (1986–1992), he was described by colleagues as withdrawn but deeply spiritual, conducting frequent retreats and providing spiritual direction according to the [Ignatian](/article/en/Ignatius_of_Loyola) tradition of the Jesuits.

In 1992, Jesuit authorities requested that Bergoglio cease living in Jesuit residences due to ongoing tensions with Jesuit leadership. Some have suggested this reflected disagreements about his theological positions, his emphasis on popular religiosity over structural social change, and his opposition to certain expressions of liberation theology. However, the exact reasons for this separation remain somewhat opaque historically.

## Episcopal Career (1992–2013)

### Auxiliary and Coadjutor Archbishop (1992–1998)

On 20 May 1992, [Pope John Paul II](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) appointed Bergoglio as auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires with the [titular see](/article/en/Titular_see) of [Auca](/article/en/Auca) (Aucensi). On 27 June 1992, he was formally consecrated bishop by Cardinal [Antonio Quarracino](/article/en/Antonio_Quarracino), the archbishop of Buenos Aires, with [Emilio Ogñénovich](/article/en/Emilio_Ogñénovich) and [Ubaldo Calabresi](/article/en/Ubaldo_Calabresi) as co-consecrators.

Bergoglio chose as his [episcopal motto](/article/en/Episcopal_motto) the Latin phrase *Miserando atque eligendo* ("By having mercy and by choosing"), drawn from a homily by [Saint Bede the Venerable](/article/en/Bede) on the Gospel passage [Matthew 9:9–13](/article/en/Gospel_of_Matthew). The motto reflects his spiritual conviction that God's mercy—not human merit or judgment—is the foundation of pastoral mission and divine election. This motto would remain central to his identity throughout his life and would appear on his [papal coat of arms](/article/en/Papal_coat_of_arms).

As auxiliary bishop, Bergoglio worked closely with aging Cardinal Quarracino. On 3 June 1997, he was appointed coadjutor archbishop with right of succession. When Quarracino died on 28 February 1998, the 61-year-old Bergoglio automatically succeeded him as metropolitan archbishop of Buenos Aires, a position traditionally associated with the role of chancellor of the [Argentine Catholic University](/article/en/Argentine_Catholic_University).

### Archbishop of Buenos Aires (1998–2013)

#### Pastoral Vision and Social Work

As archbishop from 1998 to 2013, Bergoglio established himself as a champion of the poor and marginalized. One of his major initiatives was dramatically increasing the Church's presence in the [villas miseria](/article/en/Villa_miseria) (shantytown slums) surrounding Buenos Aires. He doubled the number of priests assigned to work in these impoverished neighborhoods and made frequent pastoral visits himself, earning the affectionate nickname the "villero bishop" or "slum bishop."

Bergoglio implemented significant administrative reforms in the archdiocese. Early in his tenure, he sold the archdiocese's bank shares and moved accounts to regular international banks, ending the Church's problematic spending patterns that had nearly led to bankruptcy and instituting stricter fiscal discipline. He established new parishes, restructured archdiocesan offices, and expanded pastoral care.

His pastoral practice reflected his spiritual convictions. On [Holy Thursday](/article/en/Holy_Thursday), he regularly celebrated the ritual of [foot-washing](/article/en/Foot-washing) not in the grand [Basilica of St. John Lateran](/article/en/Basilica_of_St_John_Lateran) but in jails, hospitals, retirement homes, and slums—places of suffering and marginalization. This practice of bringing the sacred to the peripheries would later define his entire pontificate.

Bergoglio proved willing to challenge Church practices he viewed as hypocritical. He famously criticized priests who refused to baptize children born to unmarried mothers or single mothers, calling such clerics "hypocrites" who "separate God's people from salvation." He pushed for a more compassionate and inclusive pastoral approach while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy on matters like abortion and marriage.

#### Administrative and Ecclesiastical Positions

On 6 November 1998, while remaining archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio was appointed Ordinary for [Eastern Catholics](/article/en/Eastern_Catholic_Churches) in Argentina who lacked their own ecclesiastical superior. [Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk](/article/en/Sviatoslav_Shevchuk) of the [Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church](/article/en/Ukrainian_Greek_Catholic_Church) later acknowledged that Bergoglio "understood the liturgy, rites, and spirituality" of Eastern Catholicism and "always took care of our Church in Argentina."

In 2000, Bergoglio was the only Church official to publicly reconcile with [Jerónimo Podestá](/article/en/Jerónimo_Podestá), a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the [Argentine military dictatorship](/article/en/Dirty_War). Bergoglio also defended Podestá's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage, demonstrating a pastorally compassionate approach to complicated human situations.

On 8 November 2005, Bergoglio was elected president of the [Argentine Episcopal Conference](/article/en/Argentine_Episcopal_Conference) (COEEBA) for a three-year term (2005–2008) and was re-elected on 11 November 2008 for a second consecutive term. He remained a member of various ecclesiastical commissions and committees, including the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and the Conference's liturgy committee.

In 2007, shortly after [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) introduced new rules permitting the celebration of pre-[Second Vatican Council](/article/en/Second_Vatican_Council) liturgical forms, Bergoglio was among the first bishops worldwide to establish a weekly Mass in this [extraordinary form](/article/en/Tridentine_Mass) of the Roman Rite, demonstrating his respect for traditional liturgical expression alongside his pastoral innovations.

#### Government Relations and Political Engagement

Bergoglio's tenure as archbishop coincided with significant political and social changes in Argentina, and he became an influential voice in public discourse, particularly on social justice and family issues.

**Fernando de la Rúa (1999–2001):** When [Fernando de la Rúa](/article/en/Fernando_de_la_Rúa) became president in 1999, Bergoglio continued the archbishop's traditional role of celebrating the annual [Día Nacional Sanmartiniano](/article/en/Día_Nacional_Sanmartiniano) (First National Government holiday) Mass. During the severe economic crisis of 2001, Bergoglio led Church criticism of the government's austerity measures. Though de la Rúa sought Church mediation to facilitate dialogue between political and economic leaders, disagreements over the nature of such engagement ensued. During the December 2001 riots, Bergoglio contacted the Ministry of the Interior, requesting that police distinguish genuine protesters from vandals.

**Néstor Kirchner (2003–2007):** Relations with [Néstor Kirchner](/article/en/Néstor_Kirchner)'s administration proved more contentious. In 2004, when Kirchner attended the May 25 [First National Government](/article/en/First_National_Government) holiday Mass at the cathedral, Bergoglio used the homily to call for greater political dialogue and rejection of intolerance, which Kirchner interpreted as criticism. Kirchner subsequently moved the celebration elsewhere and suspended the cathedral Mass, effectively snubbing the Church. In 2006, Bergoglio supported fellow Jesuit Joaquín Piña in Misiones Province elections to prevent constitutional amendments allowing indefinite presidential re-election—a project Kirchner intended to replicate nationally. The two became rivals, with Kirchner viewing Bergoglio as a political opponent.

**Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–2015):** Relations with [Cristina Fernández de Kirchner](/article/en/Cristina_Fernández_de_Kirchner), Néstor's widow and successor, remained tense throughout her presidency. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during agricultural sector unrest, comments the government interpreted as support for anti-government demonstrators. The most significant conflict arose over same-sex marriage legislation (Law 26,618), which Bergoglio vigorously opposed in 2010. In a letter to Carmelite nuns, he characterized the proposed law as embodying a "destructive intention of God's plan," using biblical language comparing the legislative battle to a divine struggle. The letter was widely criticized as employing medieval rhetoric, and some analysts believe it inadvertently contributed to the law's passage by mobilizing supporters.

When Bergoglio was elected pope in March 2013, [Cristina Kirchner's](/article/en/Cristina_Fernández_de_Kirchner) initial reaction was ambivalent. The pro-government newspaper [Página/12](/article/en/Página_12) published renewed allegations about his Dirty War record, and the president delayed her congratulations. However, recognizing Francis's immense popularity, she underwent what political analyst Claudio Fantini termed a "Copernican shift." On 18 March 2013, the day before his papal inauguration, Bergoglio met privately with Kirchner, exchanged gifts, and shared lunch—his first meeting with a head of state as pope. This reconciliation was widely noted, and [Página/12](/article/en/Página_12) subsequently removed controversial articles about Bergoglio from its website.

**Javier Milei (2023 onwards):** Before his 2023 presidential election, [Javier Milei](/article/en/Javier_Milei) was highly critical of Francis, describing him as an "imbecile" and a "communist turd." His disparaging comments sparked Catholic controversy. Following his inauguration, however, Milei softened his position and formally invited Francis to Argentina. On 11 February 2024, Milei visited the Vatican on the day Francis canonized [María Antonia de Paz y Figueroa](/article/en/María_Antonia_de_Paz_y_Figueroa), Argentina's first female saint.

#### Election as Cardinal (2001)

On 21 February 2001, [Pope John Paul II](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) elevated Bergoglio to the rank of cardinal at an ordinary consistory, assigning him the title of [cardinal priest](/article/en/Cardinal_priest) of [San Roberto Bellarmino](/article/en/San_Roberto_Bellarmino). Bergoglio was formally installed at his titular church on 14 October 2001. During his visit to Rome for the ceremony, he and his sister María Elena visited their father's hometown in northern Italy.

As cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to five administrative positions in the [Roman Curia](/article/en/Roman_Curia):
- [Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments](/article/en/Congregation_for_Divine_Worship_and_the_Discipline_of_the_Sacraments)
- [Congregation for the Clergy](/article/en/Congregation_for_the_Clergy)
- [Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life](/article/en/Congregation_for_Institutes_of_Consecrated_Life_and_Societies_of_Apostolic_Life)
- [Pontifical Council for the Family](/article/en/Pontifical_Council_for_the_Family)
- [Commission for Latin America](/article/en/Pontifical_Commission_for_Latin_America)

Later in 2001, when Cardinal [Edward Egan](/article/en/Edward_Egan) returned to [New York](/article/en/New_York) following the [September 11 attacks](/article/en/September_11_attacks), Bergoglio replaced him as relator (recording secretary) to the [Synod of Bishops](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops). According to the [Catholic Herald](/article/en/Catholic_Herald), he made "a favorable impression as a man open to communion and dialogue."

#### The 2005 Conclave and Papabile Status

Following [Pope John Paul II's](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) death on 2 April 2005, Cardinal Bergoglio attended the funeral and emerged as a significant candidate in the 2005 papal conclave. Various accounts suggest he was a close contender to [Joseph Ratzinger](/article/en/Joseph_Ratzinger), who was ultimately elected as [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI).

According to reconstructions by Vatican analyst [Lucio Brunelli](/article/en/Lucio_Brunelli) based on a purported conclave diary, Bergoglio received substantial support and reportedly obtained 40 votes (of 77 needed for election) in one ballot—the second-highest after Ratzinger. La Stampa reported that Bergoglio was in close contention until he made an emotional plea asking cardinals not to vote for him, apparently to prevent conclave delays. However, such details remain speculative since [papal conclave](/article/en/Papal_conclave) proceedings are conducted under strict [pontifical secrecy](/article/en/Pontifical_secrecy).

#### Personal Lifestyle and Public Image as Cardinal

Cardinal Bergoglio became renowned for his personal humility and simplicity. Unlike many cardinals, he:
- Lived in a modest apartment rather than the elegant bishop's residence
- Used public transportation (subway and buses) to move around the city
- Cooked his own meals
- Avoided restaurants and media appearances
- Limited his time in Rome to brief "lightning visits"
- Refused the traditional cardinal's limousine and driver

This austere lifestyle, rooted in his Jesuit vows of poverty, earned him widespread respect and enhanced his reputation as a man of genuine faith and pastoral concern. He was known for his clear, direct language in public addresses, which provided regular headlines on topics ranging from corruption and worldliness to poverty and social injustice.

Bergoglio also demonstrated early commitment to [interreligious dialogue](/article/en/Interfaith_dialogue). He attended Jewish prayers at Buenos Aires synagogues, participated in interfaith events, and cultivated relationships with leaders of various faith communities. In 2010, in cooperation with Rabbi [Abraham Skorka](/article/en/Abraham_Skorka), he published *On Heaven and Earth*, a dialogue addressing theological and ethical questions. His relationships with Argentina's Jewish community, Muslim leaders, and Protestant churches were characterized by respect and a desire for mutual understanding.

## Papacy (2013–2025)

### The 2013 Conclave and Election

Following [Pope Benedict XVI's](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) historic resignation on 11 February 2013—the first papal resignation since [Gregory XII](/article/en/Gregory_XII) in 1415—a papal conclave was convened. The resignation took effect on 28 February 2013, initiating the [sede vacante](/article/en/Sede_vacante) period.

On 12 March 2013, 115 cardinals under the age of 80 assembled in the [Sistine Chapel](/article/en/Sistine_Chapel) for the conclave, as stipulated by the apostolic constitution *[Universi Dominici Gregis](/article/en/Universi_Dominici_Gregis)*. The morning of 12 March featured the customary celebration of the [Divine Liturgy](/article/en/Divine_Liturgy) at [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica), after which cardinals processed to the Sistine Chapel, chanting the litany of saints and invoking the Holy Spirit.

On the afternoon of 13 March 2013, Cardinal Bergoglio was elected pope on the fifth round of voting. When asked in the chapel if he accepted, he responded: "I am a great sinner, trusting in the mercy and patience of God; in suffering, I accept." At approximately 8:13 PM local time, white smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling a successful election. The bells of [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica) rang, a practice instituted by [John Paul II](/article/en/John_Paul_II).

Cardinal [Jean-Louis Tauran](/article/en/Jean-Louis_Tauran), the cardinal protodeacon, announced the election from the central loggia with the traditional Latin formula *[Habemus Papam](/article/en/Habemus_Papam)* ("We have a pope"). He presented the new pope to approximately 200,000 people gathered in [St. Peter's Square](/article/en/St_Peter's_Square).

### Papal Name and Symbolism

The new pontiff chose the papal name **Francis**, becoming the first pope to bear this name since the tradition of papal naming began. According to Church convention, no ordinal number (such as "I") was appended to his name; the Holy See clarified that "Francis I" would be used only if a future pope also took the name Francis.

In his first explanation of his choice, Francis stated that he was inspired by [Saint Francis of Assisi](/article/en/Francis_of_Assisi), the 13th-century founder of the [Franciscan order](/article/en/Franciscan_order) known for his simplicity, dedication to the poor, and mystical love of creation. During the conclave voting, [Cardinal Cláudio Hummes](/article/en/Cláudio_Hummes), archbishop emeritus of [São Paulo](/article/en/São_Paulo), had embraced Bergoglio and whispered, "Don't forget the poor," which crystallized his choice of the name associated with radical evangelical poverty.

In his inaugural homily and subsequent interviews, Francis explained his understanding of the name:

> "For me, he is the man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and cares for creation; at this moment, we too have a relationship that is not so good with creation, is it not true? He is the man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man... Ah, how I would like a poor Church and for the poor!"

Notably, some speculated that the choice also honored [Saint Francis Xavier](/article/en/Francis_Xavier), the [Jesuit](/article/en/Jesuit) missionary and co-founder, appropriate for the first Jesuit pope.

### Inaugural Mass and Early Actions

On 19 March 2013, the feast of [Saint Joseph](/article/en/Joseph), Francis celebrated his papal [inauguration](/article/en/Papal_inauguration) at [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica) in the presence of over 130 official foreign delegations and leaders of other Christian denominations. Notably, [Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I](/article/en/Bartholomew_I_of_Constantinople) attended—the first time a [Patriarch of Constantinople](/article/en/Patriarch_of_Constantinople) had attended a papal inauguration as an equal since the [Great Schism](/article/en/Great_Schism) of 1054, marking a significant ecumenical gesture.

Before the Mass, Francis traveled through [St. Peter's Square](/article/en/St_Peter's_Square) in an open-top white SUV rather than the traditional armored popemobile, stopping to greet and kiss children and the sick. In his homily, he emphasized his role as "protector" of the poor, the vulnerable, and creation itself, calling all people—especially those in positions of responsibility—to be "custodians" of these sacred charges.

In the weeks following his election, Francis made several symbolic gestures signaling a departure from recent papal precedent:

- **Residence:** Rather than occupy the [papal apartments](/article/en/Apostolic_Palace) of the [Apostolic Palace](/article/en/Apostolic_Palace), he chose to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guest house, room 201, becoming the first pope since [Pius X](/article/en/Pius_X) (1903) not to live in the official papal residence. This decision reflected his desire for a "simple way of living and living together" with other Vatican residents.

- **Vestments:** He wore a simple white cassock without the red mozzetta cape and rejected red papal shoes in favor of black ones. For his pectoral cross, he retained the simple iron cross he had worn as cardinal rather than adopting the traditional gold cross.

- **Fisherman's Ring:** He chose a silver-gilt fisherman's ring rather than gold, and wore it primarily during major liturgical celebrations.

- **First actions:** On his first full day, he visited cardinals in the Clementina Hall, thanking them for their support while praising his predecessor Benedict XVI for his "faith, his knowledge, and his humility." On 16 March, he met with journalists, blessing them and thanking them for their work, then posting his first tweet: "Dear friends, I thank you with all my heart and I ask you to continue praying for me."

- **First meetings:** On 18 March, Francis received Argentine President [Cristina Fernández de Kirchner](/article/en/Cristina_Fernández_de_Kirchner) in a 20-minute private meeting followed by lunch—his first meeting with a head of state as pope. Kirchner asked him to mediate in the [Falkland Islands](/article/en/Falkland_Islands) dispute with [Britain](/article/en/United_Kingdom).

- **Standing reception:** On 15 March, when receiving cardinals' homage in the Sistine Chapel, Francis stood rather than sitting on the papal throne, a deliberate break with protocol that symbolized his preference for equality and service over ceremonial hierarchy.

### Papal Coat of Arms and Motto

Francis's [papal coat of arms](/article/en/Papal_coat_of_arms) largely retained the design he had chosen as cardinal, with modifications appropriate to his new office:

**Shield:** Blue background (representing the firmament and the Virgin Mary's mantle, and heraldically signifying justice, serenity, strength, and nobility). At the top center is the [monogram of the Society of Jesus](/article/en/IHS) (IHS) superimposed on a radiant, flaming sun of gold, with three nails of the Passion below in black, symbolizing Christ's redemptive work. At the lower left is an eight-pointed gold star representing the [Virgin Mary](/article/en/Virgin_Mary) (mother of Christ and the Church); at the lower right is a gold spikenard flower representing [Saint Joseph](/article/en/Joseph), patron of the universal Church (in Hispanic tradition depicted with a spikenard branch).

**External ornaments:** Two crossed keys (one gold, one silver, representing spiritual and temporal authority), the [papal mitre](/article/en/Mitre), and a red cord with pendant, all following heraldic conventions for the papacy.

**Motto:** *Miserando atque eligendo* ("By having mercy, he chose him" or "Chosen through mercy"), drawn from [Saint Bede's](/article/en/Bede) homily on [Matthew 9:9](/article/en/Gospel_of_Matthew), wherein Christ chooses the tax collector Matthew through a merciful gaze rather than merit. The motto reflects the pope's conviction that [divine mercy](/article/en/Mercy) is central to salvation and pastoral ministry.

## Reforms and Governance

### Council of Cardinals and Curia Reform

On 13 April 2013, Francis announced the establishment of a [Council of Cardinal Advisers](/article/en/Council_of_Cardinals) (formally the "C9") to advise him on Church governance and the reform of the [Roman Curia](/article/en/Roman_Curia). The initial eight cardinals selected represented geographically diverse regions and included known critics of Vatican operations:

- [Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga](/article/en/Óscar_Andrés_Rodríguez_Maradiaga) (Honduras, coordinator)
- [Giuseppe Bertello](/article/en/Giuseppe_Bertello) ([Vatican](/article/en/Vatican_City_State))
- [Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa](/article/en/Francisco_Javier_Errázuriz_Ossa) ([Chile](/article/en/Chile))
- [Oswald Gracias](/article/en/Oswald_Gracias) ([India](/article/en/India))
- [Reinhard Marx](/article/en/Reinhard_Marx) ([Germany](/article/en/Germany))
- [Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya](/article/en/Laurent_Monsengwo_Pasinya) ([Democratic Republic of the Congo](/article/en/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo))
- [Sean Patrick O'Malley](/article/en/Sean_Patrick_O'Malley) ([United States](/article/en/United_States))
- [George Pell](/article/en/George_Pell) ([Australia](/article/en/Australia))

[Marcello Semeraro](/article/en/Marcello_Semeraro), bishop of Albano, served as secretary. This council met regularly to advise the pope on restructuring the Roman Curia and addressing governance challenges.

On 28 September 2013, Francis formalized the Council of Cardinals by chirograph (papal letter), establishing it as a permanent advisory body. In 2014, [Cardinal Pietro Parolin](/article/en/Pietro_Parolin), the Secretary of State, joined the council.

The council's work led to several major structural reforms:

- **Dicasteries for Laity, Family and Life** (August 2016): Merged the [Pontifical Council for the Family](/article/en/Pontifical_Council_for_the_Family) and [Pontifical Council for the Laity](/article/en/Pontifical_Council_for_the_Laity).

- **Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development** (August 2016): Consolidated four pontifical councils addressing justice, peace, migration, and healthcare.

- **Secretariat for Communications** (June 2015): Centralized Vatican communication strategy across previously fragmented offices.

- **Apostolic Constitution Praedicate Evangelium** (March 2022): Replaced [Pastor Bonus](/article/en/Pastor_Bonus) (1988), comprehensively reorganizing the Roman Curia to emphasize missionary outreach, decentralization, and lay participation. This constituted the most significant curial reform since [Pope John Paul II's](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) papacy.

### Vatican Financial Reforms

Francis made Vatican financial transparency and reform a priority from the outset of his pontificate. The [Institute for the Works of Religion](/article/en/Institute_for_the_Works_of_Religion) (informally the "[Vatican Bank](/article/en/Vatican_Bank)") had long been plagued by allegations of corruption, money laundering, and opaque dealings.

On 24 June 2013, Francis established the **Special Commission of Reference on the IOR** (CRIOR) to examine the bank's legal position and activities. The commission, led by [Cardinal Raffaele Farina](/article/en/Raffaele_Farina), included lay experts and was empowered to access confidential documents.

On 18 July 2013, Francis created the **Commission of Reference on the Economic-Administrative Structure of the Holy See** (COSEA) to analyze Vatican finances and economic management comprehensively.

These commissions led to significant changes:
- The IOR published its first annual report in October 2013 (unprecedented in its history)
- Thousands of accounts were examined, and several thousand were closed to comply with international standards
- By end of 2014, [Cardinal George Pell](/article/en/George_Pell), appointed to lead Vatican financial reform as prefect of the [Secretariat for the Economy](/article/en/Secretariat_for_the_Economy) (established February 2014), announced the discovery of "hundreds of millions of euros" hidden in private accounts not appearing on official balance sheets
- New financial oversight bodies ([Financial Information Authority](/article/en/Financial_Information_Authority), [Council for the Economy](/article/en/Council_for_the_Economy)) were established to improve governance

Francis demonstrated willingness to consider even closure of the IOR if reforms proved unworkable, though the bank ultimately continued under tighter oversight.

### Abolition of Bonuses and Economic Austerity

Shortly after his election, Francis abolished the traditional bonuses awarded to Vatican employees upon a new pope's election—amounting to several million euros—redirecting funds to charity. He also abolished the €25,000 annual bonus paid to cardinals serving on the Board of Supervisors for the Vatican Bank, demonstrating his commitment to institutional austerity aligned with his vision of a "poor Church."

### Synods and Synodality

Francis convened several major synods addressing contemporary pastoral challenges:

#### Extraordinary Synod on the Family (2014)
On 8 October 2013, Francis announced an [Extraordinary Synod of Bishops](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops) on the family, convened for October 2014—an unusually rapid response. This marked the first [extraordinary synod](/article/en/Extraordinary_Synod) focusing on the family in the Church's history.

The synod addressed contemporary family realities including cohabitation, same-sex unions, divorce and remarriage, and mixed-religion marriages. While Francis listened extensively during debates, he deferred doctrinal and pastoral resolutions pending further study at the ordinary synod in 2015.

#### Ordinary Synod on the Family (2015)
The [XIV Ordinary General Assembly](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops) (October 2015) produced the apostolic exhortation [*Amoris Laetitia*](/article/en/Amoris_Laetitia) (2016), which addressed pastoral care for families while reaffirming Church teaching on marriage. The document's pastoral approach to divorced and remarried Catholics sparked significant theological controversy (discussed below).

#### Synod on Youth (2018)
The [XV Ordinary General Assembly](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops) (October 2018) focused on "Young People, Faith, and Vocational Discernment." The resulting apostolic exhortation [*Christus Vivit*](/article/en/Christus_Vivit) addressed youth engagement with faith, sexual abuse prevention, and the Church's modernization.

#### Synod for the Amazon (2019)
The [Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazonian Region](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops) (October 2019) explored evangelization, indigenous rights, environmental protection, and ecological conversion. The resulting exhortation [*Querida Amazonia*](/article/en/Querida_Amazonia) emphasized indigenous participation and Amazonian church autonomy while addressing [Pope Francis's](/article/en/Pope_Francis) environmental concerns.

#### Synod on Synodality (2021–2024)
On 10 October 2021, Francis inaugurated a three-year process exploring the concept of "[synodality](/article/en/Synodality)"—the Church's collegial, consultative decision-making style. The process included three phases:
1. **Diocesan phase** (October 2021 – April 2022)
2. **Continental phase** (September 2022 – March 2023)
3. **Universal phase**: The [XVI Ordinary General Assembly](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops) convened in two sessions (October 4-29, 2023; October 2-27, 2024)

Notably, the 2023 session was the first to permit women to vote in a [Catholic Synod of Bishops](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops), a historic opening. On 26 October 2024, in an unprecedented gesture, Francis presented and ratified the synod's final document himself, granting it magisterial authority without issuing a separate apostolic exhortation.

The Synod on Synodality has been widely described as the culmination of Francis's papacy and the most significant event in the Catholic Church since the [Second Vatican Council](/article/en/Second_Vatican_Council).

## Doctrinal Teaching and Moral Positions

### Encyclicals and Major Documents

Francis authored four [encyclicals](/article/en/Encyclical) and numerous [apostolic exhortations](/article/en/Apostolic_exhortation) that articulated his theological vision:

#### *Lumen Fidei* (Light of Faith, 2013)
His first encyclical, largely completed by [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) before his resignation, was finalized and published by Francis on 29 June 2013. The document addresses faith as a light illuminating human existence and traces the history of faith from Abraham through Christ to the contemporary Church.

#### *Laudato Si'* (Praise Be, 2015)
Published on 24 May 2015 (Pentecost), this landmark encyclical addresses [climate change](/article/en/Climate_change), environmental degradation, and [integral ecology](/article/en/Integral_ecology). Francis argues that environmental destruction disproportionately harms the poor and vulnerable, making ecological protection a matter of justice. The document critiques "throwaway culture," consumerism, and unbridled [capitalism](/article/en/Capitalism), calling for conversion to sustainable practices and renewed appreciation for creation as divine gift.

#### *Fratelli Tutti* (All Brothers, 2020)
Signed on 3 October 2020 at the tomb of [Saint Francis of Assisi](/article/en/Francis_of_Assisi) in Assisi, this encyclical addresses [fraternity](/article/en/Fraternity) and social friendship in a fractured world. Inspired by the [Document on Human Fraternity](/article/en/Document_on_Human_Fraternity) signed with Grand Imam [Ahmed al-Tayeb](/article/en/Ahmed_al-Tayeb) in Abu Dhabi, it calls for dialogue across religious and ideological boundaries, rejects isolationism and populism, and envisions a more just, peaceful global order.

#### *Dilexit Nos* (He Loved Us, 2024)
Francis's final encyclical, published 24 October 2024, focuses on the [Sacred Heart of Jesus](/article/en/Sacred_Heart_of_Jesus), exploring themes of divine love and human response. The document represents a synthesis of his spiritual vision.

### Key Moral Teachings

#### Mercy and Pastoral Approach

Central to Francis's teaching is the conviction that [divine mercy](/article/en/Mercy)—God's loving compassion—must permeate the Church's mission. His papal motto, *Miserando atque eligendo*, encapsulates this conviction. Mercy, for Francis, is not sentimentality but the foundation of authentic pastoral care and moral transformation.

In his apostolic exhortation [*Evangelii Gaudium*](/article/en/Evangelii_Gaudium) (The Joy of the Gospel, 2013), Francis articulated what would be the programmatic themes of his papacy:
- A missionary impulse encouraging all Catholics to actively share faith
- Avoiding worldliness by visibly living the Gospel
- Preferential option for the poor and engagement in social justice
- Joy and hope as the tone of Christian witness

#### Abortion and Euthanasia

Francis maintained the Catholic Church's traditional prohibition of [abortion](/article/en/Abortion), describing it as "a grave sin" and "unjust killing" of an innocent human being. However, he emphasized pastoral compassion, stating in 2015 that priests should extend [sacramental forgiveness](/article/en/Sacrament_of_Penance) to women who have had abortions, affirming that "there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and destroy when it finds a repentant heart."

In 2024, during an apostolic journey to [Belgium](/article/en/Belgium), Francis made controversial remarks calling abortion "murder" and referring to doctors who perform abortions as "assassins" if they act knowingly. The Vatican later clarified his intent to condemn the act rather than make blanket moral judgments about individual healthcare providers' culpability, which depends on subjective factors.

On [euthanasia](/article/en/Euthanasia), Francis maintained firm opposition, arguing in 2017 and 2024 that while accepting the limit of human mortality is ethically acceptable, actively ending life violates human dignity and is incompatible with authentic palliative care.

#### Same-Sex Relationships and LGBTQ Issues

Francis's teaching on homosexuality and LGBTQ issues has represented a notable evolution in papal rhetoric, though not in fundamental doctrine.

**Traditional teaching:** The Catholic Church maintains that homosexual acts are "intrinsically disordered" (contrary to natural law) while calling for respect and pastoral care for homosexual persons. Francis affirmed this teaching consistently.

**Pastoral tone:** In a famous July 2013 statement during his return flight from [World Youth Day](/article/en/World_Youth_Day) in [Brazil](/article/en/Brazil), Francis declared: "If a person is gay and seeks the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?" This remark, widely reported internationally, signaled a shift in papal tone—emphasizing mercy, welcome, and non-judgment over condemnation.

**Civil unions:** In October 2020, during an interview for the documentary *Francesco*, Francis expressed support for civil union legislation protecting same-sex couples' legal rights, stating: "Homosexual people have the right to be in the family. They are children of God... What we have to do is a civil union law." The Vatican initially clarified that he was discussing civil, not sacramental, unions, but his statement represented the most explicit papal support for legal protections for same-sex couples.

**Blessing of same-sex couples:** On 18 December 2023, Francis approved the declaration [*Fiducia Supplicans*](/article/en/Fiducia_Supplicans) from the [Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith), permitting priests to offer "spontaneous blessings" to same-sex couples, civilly remarried divorcees, and other couples in "irregular situations." The document clarified that such blessings do not constitute sacramental validation of union but rather pastoral acknowledgment of God's love for all people. The declaration sparked significant controversy among conservative Catholics and affirming reactions from progressive Catholics and LGBTQ advocates.

**Gender ideology:** While expressing compassion for transgender persons, Francis has criticized what he terms "gender ideology"—theories denying biological sex distinctions or treating gender as purely socially constructed. In 2023 and 2024, he reiterated that "holy orders is reserved for men" and spoke of concern regarding gender-affirming medical interventions for minors, describing some educational approaches as "ideological colonization."

#### Women in the Church

Francis affirmed the Church's prohibition on [women's ordination](/article/en/Womens_ordination) to the priesthood and episcopacy, stating the door is "closed." He emphasized that women possessed roles of equal importance to ordained ministries, recalling that women were the first witnesses to the [Resurrection](/article/en/Resurrection_of_Jesus) and bear responsibility for transmitting faith to subsequent generations.

However, Francis undertook significant initiatives to increase women's participation in Church governance:

- In January 2021, he issued the apostolic letter [*Spiritus Domini*](/article/en/Spiritus_Domini), allowing bishops to institute women to the lay ministries of acolyte and lector (previously reserved to men, though women had performed these functions unofficially in most dioceses).

- In February 2021, he appointed women to positions previously held only by men, including [Nathalie Becquart](/article/en/Nathalie_Becquart) (French religious sister) as co-undersecretary of the [Synod of Bishops](/article/en/Synod_of_Bishops), and [Catia Summaria](/article/en/Catia_Summaria) (Italian magistrate) as the first woman Promoter of Justice in the [Vatican's Court of Appeals](/article/en/Vatican_Court_of_Appeals).

- In April 2023, he announced that 35 women would be allowed to vote at the Sixteenth Synod of Bishops (just over 10% of voters), the first time women participated in synodal voting.

- He established women as full voting members on various dicasteries, including the [Dicastery for Bishops](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Bishops).

Regarding the possibility of women deacons, Francis created study commissions (2016, 2020) to research historical precedent. However, in 2023-2024 interviews, he appeared to reject the possibility, stating that "holy orders is reserved for men" and that women's separate charism differs from ordained ministry.

### Death Penalty

In 2018, Francis formally revised the [Catechism of the Catholic Church](/article/en/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church) (Article 2267) to declare the [death penalty](/article/en/Capital_punishment) "inadmissible" in light of Gospel values and human dignity. In his 2020 encyclical *[Fratelli Tutti](/article/en/Fratelli_Tutti)*, he reiterated that "there can be no stepping back from this position," committing the Church to worldwide abolition.

Francis's 2018 reformulation marked an evolution from the 1992 Catechism, which permitted capital punishment in limited circumstances. His stance represented a significant doctrinal development influenced by his conviction that life's sacredness admits no exceptions.

### Environmental Protection and Climate Change

*[Laudato Si'](/article/en/Laudato_Si)* represents Francis's most comprehensive treatment of environmental concerns. In this encyclical and subsequent writings, he:

- Affirmed the scientific consensus on [climate change](/article/en/Climate_change) and called for urgent mitigation measures
- Criticized consumerism, throwaway culture, and economic systems prioritizing profit over creation care
- Connected environmental degradation to poverty and injustice, arguing that the poor suffer most severely from ecological crises
- Called for "integral ecology" recognizing interconnections between human and natural systems
- Advocated renewable energy, reduced emissions, and sustainable development respecting planetary boundaries
- Critiqued "demographic terrorism" (inadequate response to environmental crisis) and "ecological debt" owed by wealthy nations to the Global South

In October 2023, ahead of [COP28](/article/en/2023_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), Francis issued the apostolic exhortation [*Laudate Deum*](/article/en/Laudate_Deum), intensifying calls for climate action and condemning climate change denial. In June 2024, he announced Vatican plans to construct an agrivoltaics facility on church property outside Rome, symbolizing institutional commitment to ecological conversion.

### Poverty, Economic Justice, and Consumerism

Francis emerged as an outspoken critic of what he termed "[throwaway culture](/article/en/Consumerism)"—contemporary capitalism's tendency to discard both material goods and vulnerable human beings deemed economically unproductive.

In [*Evangelii Gaudium*](/article/en/Evangelii_Gaudium), he declared:
> "Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets clear boundaries to protect human life, today we also say 'thou shalt not kill' to economic exclusion and inequality."

He criticized:
- Trickle-down economics and unbridled market autonomy
- Financial speculation divorced from productive economy
- Global inequality and inadequate wages (referencing the [Rana Plaza](/article/en/Rana_Plaza) factory collapse as embodying "slave labor")
- Indifference to migrants, refugees, and displaced persons
- Exploitation of children, women, and vulnerable populations

Francis advocated:
- Increased taxation on billionaires and redistribution toward the poor
- Universal basic income and living wages
- Regulation of financial markets
- Economic systems prioritizing human dignity and common good over profit maximization

His economic critiques drew comparisons to [liberation theology](/article/en/Liberation_theology), though he maintained distinct positions: he affirmed the potential for reformed capitalism to serve justice, opposed Marxist ideology, and emphasized Church independence from political movements while advocating for structural economic change.

## International Diplomacy and Relations

### Cuba and United States Normalization

Francis played a key diplomatic role in the historic restoration of relations between the [United States](/article/en/United_States) and [Cuba](/article/en/Cuba) following over 50 years of antagonism. In 2014, [President Barack Obama](/article/en/Barack_Obama) approached Francis during a Vatican visit, requesting Church mediation.

Working behind the scenes with the help of the [Canadian government](/article/en/Canada), Francis negotiated key terms leading to the 12 December 2014 announcement of normalized diplomatic relations. U.S. officials credited Francis with crucial credibility as a trusted religious leader acceptable to both sides, enabling both governments to commit to following through on agreements.

In September 2015, Francis visited both [Cuba](/article/en/Cuba) and the [United States](/article/en/United_States). In Cuba, he met with both [Fidel Castro](/article/en/Fidel_Castro) (retired) and [Raúl Castro](/article/en/Raúl_Castro) (then-president). In the U.S., he became the first pope to address a joint session of [Congress](/article/en/United_States_Congress), delivering a speech emphasizing Catholic social teaching on poverty, immigration, and the death penalty.

### Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

In May 2014, Francis made an [apostolic journey](/article/en/Apostolic_journey) to [Israel](/article/en/Israel) and [Palestine](/article/en/Palestine), offering symbolic gestures and prayers for peace to both peoples:

- Visited the [Western Wall](/article/en/Western_Wall), [Yad Vashem](/article/en/Yad_Vashem) Holocaust memorial, and [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](/article/en/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre)
- Became the first pope to visit the grave of [Theodor Herzl](/article/en/Theodor_Herzl), founder of modern [Zionism](/article/en/Zionism)
- Entered the West Bank from [Jordan](/article/en/Jordan) rather than [Israel](/article/en/Israel)
- Prayed at a section of the [Israeli West Bank barrier](/article/en/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier)
- Invited both [Mahmoud Abbas](/article/en/Mahmoud_Abbas) ([Palestinian Authority](/article/en/Palestinian_Authority) president) and [Shimon Peres](/article/en/Shimon_Peres) ([Israeli](/article/en/Israel) president) to a prayer summit at the [Vatican](/article/en/Vatican_City)

In May 2015, Francis welcomed Abbas to the Vatican, and on 13 May 2015, the Vatican announced its intention to sign a treaty recognizing [Palestine](/article/en/Palestine) as a state, which it did later that month—the first such papal treaty with a Palestinian state.

Throughout subsequent years, Francis repeatedly called for peace, a two-state solution respecting both peoples' rights, and dialogue. However, after October 2023, as the [Israel-Gaza conflict](/article/en/Israel-Gaza_conflict) escalated, Francis's statements became increasingly critical of Israeli military operations:

- In November 2024, he suggested the international community investigate whether Israel's campaign in Gaza constitutes [genocide](/article/en/Genocide) of Palestinians
- From October 2023 until his death, he reported maintaining nightly contact with the only Catholic church in Gaza
- In his final public Easter address (20 April 2025), he called for a Gaza ceasefire and condemned the "deplorable humanitarian situation"

### China and Religious Freedom

Francis adopted a notably more conciliatory approach toward [China](/article/en/China) than previous popes, attempting to normalize Vatican-China relations despite the Vatican's diplomatic recognition of [Taiwan](/article/en/Taiwan).

In 2018, Francis approved a provisional Vatican-China agreement aimed at regularizing the status of China's approximately 10 million Catholics. Previously, the [Chinese government](/article/en/Government_of_China) unilaterally appointed bishops through the state-controlled [Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association](/article/en/Chinese_Patriotic_Catholic_Association), contrary to [papal](/article/en/Papacy) authority to appoint bishops. Under the 2018 agreement:

- The Vatican consults with the Chinese government on bishop appointments
- The Vatican pledges not to appoint bishops without Beijing's approval
- The Chinese government recognizes the pope as the supreme head of the Church

The agreement was renewed for two-year periods in October 2020, October 2022, and October 2024.

**Controversy:** The agreement drew strong criticism from [Cardinal Joseph Zen](/article/en/Joseph_Zen), who called it a step toward the "annihilation" of the Catholic Church in China. Critics argued Francis prioritized diplomatic rapprochement over religious freedom and papal authority.

**Chinese violations:** The Chinese government repeatedly violated the agreement by unilaterally installing bishops without Vatican approval (e.g., [John Peng Weizhao](/article/en/John_Peng_Weizhao) in 2022; [Joseph Shen Bin](/article/en/Joseph_Shen_Bin) in 2023). Francis's pragmatic response—eventually recognizing problematic appointments "for the greater good of the diocese"—frustrated religious freedom advocates but reflected his conviction that imperfect dialogue was preferable to isolation.

In November 2020, Francis listed China's [Uyghur](/article/en/Uyghur) minority among the world's persecuted peoples, expressing concern about their treatment. [Chinese government spokesperson Zhao Lijian](/article/en/Zhao_Lijian) dismissed the statement as lacking "factual basis."

### Russia and Ukraine

Following Russia's [invasion of Ukraine](/article/en/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) on 24 February 2022, Francis undertook unprecedented diplomatic moves:

- In early March, he visited the [Russian embassy](/article/en/Embassy_of_Russia) to the Holy See in Rome—described as an extraordinary gesture—urging an immediate ceasefire
- He dispatched two high-ranking cardinals ([Konrad Krajewski](/article/en/Konrad_Krajewski), papal almoner; [Michael Czerny](/article/en/Michael_Czerny), dicastery head) on several humanitarian missions to Ukraine
- On 25 March 2022, he consecrated Russia and Ukraine to the [Immaculate Heart of Mary](/article/en/Immaculate_Heart_of_Mary)
- He repeatedly called for peace and dialogue, describing Ukraine as "martyred" while initially avoiding explicit criticism of Russia and President [Vladimir Putin](/article/en/Vladimir_Putin)

**Criticism:** Francis's reluctance to directly condemn Russia frustrated many Ukrainians and Western leaders, who perceived his calls for "dialogue with the aggressor" as morally problematic and potentially advantageous to the invading power. In May 2022, he suggested in an interview that NATO's expansion had provoked Russian concerns and may have contributed to the war—a formulation many saw as echoing Russian justifications.

**Later clarifications:** By October 2022, Francis directly appealed to Putin to halt the "spiral of violence and death." In November 2022, he explicitly identified Russia as "the invader." However, critics noted he continued to distinguish between Russian state actors and Russian ethnic minorities (Chechens, Buryats), a distinction that drew complaints from those groups.

Francis's diplomatic vision appeared to reflect hope (ultimately unrealized by analysts) that the Vatican could broker a peace agreement, a role he actively pursued despite limited success.

### Middle East, Islamic Relations, and Interfaith Dialogue

Francis prioritized dialogue with [Islam](/article/en/Islam) and Muslim-majority nations more explicitly than recent predecessors:

**Grand Imam Ahmed al-Tayeb:** On 4 February 2019, Francis and Grand Imam [Ahmed al-Tayeb](/article/en/Ahmed_al-Tayeb) of [Al-Azhar](/article/en/Al-Azhar) signed the [Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together](/article/en/Document_on_Human_Fraternity) in Abu Dhabi. The document affirmed religious pluralism, condemned violence and terrorism, and called for dialogue and coexistence. It inspired the [United Nations](/article/en/United_Nations) to designate 4 February as [International Day of Human Fraternity](/article/en/International_Day_of_Human_Fraternity).

**Iraq:** In March 2021, Francis became the first pope to visit [Iraq](/article/en/Iraq), celebrating Mass, visiting [Ur](/article/en/Ur) (traditional birthplace of [Abraham](/article/en/Abraham)), and meeting with Grand Ayatollah [Ali al-Sistani](/article/en/Ali_al-Sistani), Iraq's most influential Shia religious leader. The meeting symbolized interfaith respect and commitment to Christian-Muslim coexistence.

**Indonesia:** In September 2024, Francis visited [Indonesia](/article/en/Indonesia), the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. He participated in interfaith dialogue at [Istiqlal Mosque](/article/en/Istiqlal_Mosque) in [Jakarta](/article/en/Jakarta) and signed the Joint Declaration of Istiqlal with Grand Imam [Nasaruddin Umar](/article/en/Nasaruddin_Umar), emphasizing shared values and opposition to violence.

**Persecution and ISIL:** Francis condemned the persecution of Christians by [ISIL](/article/en/ISIL) in Iraq and [Syria](/article/en/Syria), supported military intervention to protect religious minorities, and met with [Yazidi](/article/en/Yazidi) refugees in Europe, calling upon the international community to prevent genocide.

**Abu Dhabi 2019:** During his February 2019 visit to the [United Arab Emirates](/article/en/United_Arab_Emirates), Francis became the first pope to celebrate [Mass](/article/en/Mass_(liturgy)) on the [Arabian Peninsula](/article/en/Arabian_Peninsula), attended by over 120,000 people at Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

### Ecumenical Relations

Francis actively promoted dialogue with other Christian denominations:

**Orthodox Churches:** He received [Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I](/article/en/Bartholomew_I_of_Constantinople) at his 2013 installation (the first such attendance since the [Great Schism](/article/en/Great_Schism)). On 12 February 2016, he met with [Patriarch Kirill I](/article/en/Kirill_I) of the [Russian Orthodox Church](/article/en/Russian_Orthodox_Church) in [Havana](/article/en/Havana), the first papal-patriarchal meeting in nearly a thousand years, producing a joint statement on religious freedom and Christian persecution.

**Coptic Orthodox:** He received [Pope Tawadros II](/article/en/Tawadros_II) of the [Coptic Orthodox Church](/article/en/Coptic_Orthodox_Church) in May 2013, working to restore relations interrupted during Benedict XVI's papacy.

**Protestant and Anglican:** Francis engaged positively with Protestant and Anglican leaders, emphasizing shared faith in Christ while acknowledging historical divisions.

### Migrants, Refugees, and Immigration

Francis made the plight of migrants and refugees a central concern throughout his papacy. His first apostolic journey outside Rome was to [Lampedusa](/article/en/Lampedusa), Italy (7 July 2013), where he threw wreaths into the sea commemorating migrants who died attempting to reach Europe. He declared: "We have become accustomed to other people's suffering, we have lost the awareness of bearing sibling responsibility."

In 2016, accompanied by [Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I](/article/en/Bartholomew_I) and Archbishop [Ieronimos II](/article/en/Ieronimos_II) of Athens, Francis visited the [Moria refugee camp](/article/en/Moria_refugee_camp) on [Lesbos](/article/en/Lesbos), drawing international attention to the [2015 European migrant crisis](/article/en/European_migrant_crisis).

Francis repeatedly criticized "neo-nationalism" and "right-wing populism" that reject migrants and refugees. In 2019, he erected a statue in [St. Peter's Square](/article/en/St_Peter's_Square) depicting a migrant family to highlight the Christian imperative toward hospitality.

In February 2025, in response to [Donald Trump's](/article/en/Donald_Trump) mass deportation policies, Francis wrote what commentators described as "an extraordinary and excoriating response to US bishops," citing the [parable of the Good Samaritan](/article/en/Good_Samaritan) and defining the [*ordo amoris*](/article/en/Ordo_amoris) (right ordering of love) as extending to all humanity, not merely family, community, or nation.

### Engagement with International Organizations

In September 2015, Francis became the first pope to address the [United Nations General Assembly](/article/en/United_Nations_General_Assembly), delivering a speech on sustainable development, poverty, and peace. In June 2023, he addressed the [UN Security Council](/article/en/UN_Security_Council) (statement read on his behalf due to health concerns), calling for peace in global conflicts.

On 14 June 2024, Francis participated in the [G7](/article/en/G7) summit in [Borgio Egnazia](/article/en/Borgio_Egnazia), [Italy](/article/en/Italy), becoming the first pope to attend a G7 meeting. He addressed issues including artificial intelligence, economic inequality, and armed conflicts.

## Sexual Abuse Crisis Response

### Overview and Context

Francis inherited and continued efforts to address the [Catholic Church sexual abuse crisis](/article/en/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_scandal), a catastrophic breach of trust involving decades of abuse by clergy and systemic cover-ups by Church leadership. Despite significant progress on some fronts, his record on this issue remains contested and complex.

### Early Actions and Inconsistencies

In his first days as pope, Francis took some positive steps: in April 2013, he instructed [Archbishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller](/article/en/Gerhard_Ludwig_Müller), prefect of the [Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith), to act decisively on abuse cases, promoting victim protection and holding perpetrators accountable.

However, early in his pontificate, Francis made controversial decisions:

- In 2014, he reversed the laicization of [Mauro Inzoli](/article/en/Mauro_Inzoli), an Italian priest [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) had removed from the priesthood for sexually abusing minors. Francis kept Inzoli as a priest but in restricted ministry. Inzoli was later convicted of abuse in 2016 and imprisoned. In 2017, Francis acknowledged he had "mishandled" the case as a new pope unfamiliar with abuse complexities.

- In 2015, Francis appointed [Juan Barros](/article/en/Juan_Barros), a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse by [Fernando Karadima](/article/en/Fernando_Karadima), to head the Diocese of Osorno. Public outrage ensued. In 2018, Francis acknowledged making "grave errors of judgment" regarding Barros, apologized to victims, and initiated an investigation resulting in Barros's resignation.

### Institutional Reforms

Despite early missteps, Francis implemented significant institutional reforms:

- **Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors** (established 2013; formally constituted 2014): Created an independent body to advise the pope on abuse prevention and victim support. Initial members included [Marie Collins](/article/en/Marie_Collins) (abuse survivor and Irish activist), [Catherine Bonnet](/article/en/Catherine_Bonnet) (French child psychologist), and [Sean Patrick O'Malley](/article/en/Sean_Patrick_O'Malley) (American cardinal known for advocacy on abuse issues).

- **Motu Proprio *Vos Estis Lux Mundi*** (May 2019): This decree established new procedural standards requiring:
  - Mandatory reporting of allegations by clergy and religious to Church authorities and, importantly, compliance with local civil law enforcement reporting requirements
  - Accountability of bishops and religious superiors for cover-ups
  - Investigation and removal of abusers from ministry
  - Protection of victims and witnesses from retaliation
  - Transparency in investigations

The decree represented a major shift, requiring internal Church compliance with civil law and moving beyond the [pontifical secrecy](/article/en/Pontifical_secrecy) that had historically shielded abuse cases.

- **Revision of Church Penal Code** (2019, updated 2023): Expanded definitions of abuse to include "vulnerable adults," broadened accountability to lay church leaders, and strengthened victim protections.

- **Abuse Summit** (February 2019): Francis convened the first global summit of bishops, abuse experts, and victim advocates to address the crisis. While some survivors criticized the summit for lacking concrete enforcement mechanisms, it signaled papal commitment to transparency.

### Criticized Decisions and Unresolved Cases

Despite these reforms, Francis faced continued criticism:

- **Theodore McCarrick case:** In 2019, Francis defrocked [Theodore McCarrick](/article/en/Theodore_McCarrick), former archbishop of [Washington](/article/en/Washington,_D.C.), after a Vatican investigation found he had sexually molested both adults and minors. However, [Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò](/article/en/Carlo_Maria_Viganò), a Vatican whistleblower, alleged in August 2018 that Francis had known of McCarrick's abuse since 2013 and had not acted. The Vatican investigation, released in November 2020, largely faulted [Pope John Paul II](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) for appointing McCarrick and [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) for failing to enforce restrictions, while concluding Francis had "limited information" before 2017.

- **Bernard Law funeral:** In December 2017, Francis presided over the solemn funeral of [Cardinal Bernard Law](/article/en/Bernard_Law), archbishop emeritus of [Boston](/article/en/Boston), who had protected numerous child-abusing priests during the [Boston abuse crisis](/article/en/Boston_abuse_scandal). Law's burial in the prestigious [Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore](/article/en/Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_Maggiore) provoked anger from survivors, and many perceived Francis's ceremonial honor as inadequately acknowledging Law's role in systemic cover-ups.

- **Marko Rupnik case:** The handling of Slovenian priest and artist [Marko Rupnik](/article/en/Marko_Rupnik), accused of psychological, spiritual, and sexual abuse against multiple women including nuns, drew significant criticism. Initially, the [Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith) declined prosecution citing statute of limitations despite acknowledging a case existed. Following public outcry, Francis ordered the case reopened. However, Rupnik was expelled from the [Jesuits](/article/en/Society_of_Jesus) for disobedience (not abuse) and continued as a priest in another diocese. His artwork remains in Vatican use, including in Francis's residence, despite requests from the [Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors](/article/en/Pontifical_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Minors) for removal.

- **Commission resignations:** Over time, key commission members resigned in frustration:
  - [Peter Saunders](/article/en/Peter_Saunders) (2016): Criticized the commission's impotence regarding [Cardinal George Pell](/article/en/George_Pell), an abuse-case figure who occupied influential Vatican positions
  - [Marie Collins](/article/en/Marie_Collins) (2017): Denounced how Vatican dicasteries rejected commission proposals and failed to respond to victim letters
  - [Catherine Bonnet](/article/en/Catherine_Bonnet) (2018): Cited insurmountable obstacles including pontifical secrecy and insufficient reporting requirements

### Net Assessment

Historians and advocates offer mixed evaluations:

**Positive aspects:** Francis implemented mandatory reporting, established victim-centered oversight bodies, removed some notorious abusers, and signaled moral seriousness about the crisis.

**Persistent problems:** Pontifical secrecy, statute of limitations defenses, treatment of complicit bishops (often reassigned rather than removed), and insufficient victim compensation have continued. Some argue Francis's reformist intent was constrained by Vatican institutional resistance and his own occasional lapses in judgment.

## Canonizations and Beatifications

Francis presided over an unprecedented number of canonizations and beatifications, far exceeding [Pope John Paul II's](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) record. By 2025, he had canonized 942 blessed and beatified 1,541 servants of God.

Notable canonizations include:

- [Mother Teresa](/article/en/Mother_Teresa) (2016): Founder of Missionaries of Charity
- [Óscar Romero](/article/en/Óscar_Romero) (2018): Salvadoran archbishop martyred for advocacy on behalf of the poor
- [John XXIII](/article/en/Pope_John_XXIII) and [John Paul II](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) (2014): His two immediate predecessors
- [Paul VI](/article/en/Pope_Paul_VI) (2018): Pope during [Vatican II](/article/en/Second_Vatican_Council) and Humanae Vitae controversy
- Shepherds of the [Fatima apparitions](/article/en/Apparitions_of_Our_Lady_of_Fatima): [Francisco Marto](/article/en/Francisco_Marto) and [Jacinta Marto](/article/en/Jacinta_Marto) (2017)
- [Junípero Serra](/article/en/Junípero_Serra) (2015): Spanish Franciscan missionary in California (canonization sparked controversy among Native American groups regarding colonization and forced conversion)
- [María Antonia de Paz y Figueroa](/article/en/María_Antonia_de_Paz_y_Figueroa) (2024): Argentina's first female saint

Additionally, Francis declared two new [Doctors of the Church](/article/en/Doctor_of_the_Church):
- [Saint Gregory of Narek](/article/en/Gregory_of_Narek) (2015)
- [Saint Irenaeus of Lyon](/article/en/Irenaeus) (2022)

## College of Cardinals and Consistories

Francis dramatically reshaped the [College of Cardinals](/article/en/College_of_Cardinals) through ten consistories (2014–2024), creating 163 cardinals from 76 countries. His appointments reflected his priorities:

**Geographical diversification:** He reduced European dominance of the College, appointing many cardinals from the Global South, Africa, and developing nations, including from countries that had never had cardinals.

**Pastoral emphasis:** Unlike [Pope Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI), who favored academically accomplished curial officials, Francis selected cardinals known for pastoral work among the poor and marginalized.

**Decentralization:** Fewer Roman Curia officials received the cardinalate, reflecting his vision of a more decentralized Church.

**Results:** After the 2024 consistory, 110 of Francis's appointed cardinals were under 80 and thus eligible to vote in future conclaves—ensuring his reform agenda would influence papal succession.

Notably, [Robert Francis Prevost](/article/en/Robert_Francis_Prevost), whom Francis created cardinal in 2023, was elected as [Pope Leo XIV](/article/en/Pope_Leo_XIV) on 8 May 2025, succeeding Francis.

## Personal Lifestyle and Public Image

### Simplicity and Humility

Throughout his papacy, Francis maintained the simple, humble lifestyle for which he was known as archbishop:

- **Residence:** He lived in room 201 of the [Domus Sanctae Marthae](/article/en/Domus_Sanctae_Marthae) guest house rather than the [papal apartments](/article/en/Apostolic_Palace), becoming the first pope since [Pius X](/article/en/Pius_X) not to occupy the official papal residence.

- **Vestments:** He wore simple white cassocks without ornate capes, preferred black shoes to ceremonial red, and retained his iron cardinal's cross rather than gold.

- **Technology:** He was reportedly unfamiliar with computers and mobile phones, conducting business primarily through landline telephones and direct conversation. In January 2025, shortly before his death, he donated approximately €200,000 of personal wealth to support a pasta-making project at a youth prison in Rome.

### Media Presence and Influence

Despite his personal technological limitations, Francis achieved unprecedented media reach:

- **Social Media:** He became the first pope to create an [Instagram account](/article/en/Instagram) (2016), gaining over one million followers in under 12 hours—a platform record at the time.

- **Publications:** In 2024, he published *Hope: My Journey in History* (also titled *Life: My Story Through History*), an autobiography presented as "a historic publication" and the first memoirs published by a pope in office.

- **Op-eds:** On 26 November 2020, he became the first pope to write an op-ed for [The New York Times](/article/en/The_New_York_Times), addressing COVID-19 and global solidarity.

- **Cultural impact:** He was named [Time Magazine](/article/en/Time_Magazine) "Person of the Year" in 2013 and appeared on the cover of [Rolling Stone](/article/en/Rolling_Stone) in January 2014. He was included in [Forbes](/article/en/Forbes) "50 Greatest Leaders" and "Most Powerful People" lists.

- **Speech patterns:** His homilies and public addresses, known for conversational tone and accessible language, generated regular media headlines for their directness on sensitive topics.

### Interests and Personality

Francis maintained lifelong interests:
- **Sports:** Passionate lifelong supporter of [San Lorenzo de Almagro](/article/en/San_Lorenzo_de_Almagro) football club; in 2014, when the team won the [Copa Libertadores](/article/en/Copa_Libertadores), Francis received them at his residence
- **Literature and philosophy:** Admirer of [Jorge Luis Borges](/article/en/Jorge_Luis_Borges), [Fyodor Dostoevsky](/article/en/Fyodor_Dostoevsky), and [Romano Guardini](/article/en/Romano_Guardini)
- **Opera and tango:** Enjoyed classical music and Argentine tango dancing
- **Humor:** Known for spontaneous jokes and warmth in personal interactions, often catching people off-guard with his informality and accessibility

### Languages

Francis was fluent in:
- **Spanish** (native language)
- **Italian** (the "everyday language" of the Holy See)
- **Latin** (official language of the Church; though Vatican linguist [Wilfried Stroh](/article/en/Wilfried_Stroh) noted Francis would have struggled with fluent conversation)
- **German** (fluent)
- **French** (intermediate)
- **Portuguese** (conversational)
- **English** (limited)
- **Ukrainian** and **Piedmontese** (some understanding)

## Health, Later Years, and Death

### Health Conditions and Hospitalizations

Throughout his papacy, Francis faced increasing health challenges:

**Early years:** He reported good health despite the lung surgery of his youth.

**2021:** In July, he underwent [colon surgery](/article/en/Colon_surgery) at Gemelli Hospital for symptomatic diverticular stenosis, requiring a week's hospitalization.

**2022:** He began using a wheelchair for public appearances due to persistent knee pain and sciatica, conditions that would plague him for the remainder of his life.

**2023:** 
- March: Hospitalized with acute respiratory infection; discharged after a few days
- June: Underwent abdominal wall surgery (laparotomy with hernia repair), remaining hospitalized for approximately two weeks

**February–March 2025:**
- On 14 February 2025, Francis entered Gemelli Hospital with bronchitis and a polymicrobial respiratory infection complicated by bilateral pneumonia
- The Vatican described his condition as "critical"; he received blood transfusions and high-flow oxygen therapy
- He was placed on non-invasive mechanical ventilation, experiencing two episodes of acute respiratory failure
- On 23 March, after over a month of hospitalization, he was discharged; doctors recommended at least two months of home recovery
- On 6 April, he appeared publicly for the first time since hospitalization, from his residence balcony
- On 20 April (Easter Sunday), he appeared at the central loggia of [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica), delivering his final Easter address and calling for Gaza ceasefire

### Last Public Appearance and Death

On **20 April 2025** (Easter Sunday), Francis made his final public appearance from the central balcony of [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica), delivering his Easter message and imparting the [Urbi et Orbi blessing](/article/en/Urbi_et_Orbi). In his address, he called for peace and ceasefire in Gaza and emphasized themes of resurrection and hope.

On **21 April 2025** (Easter Monday), at approximately **7:35 AM** local time (UTC+2), Francis died at his residence in Domus Sanctae Marthae at age 88. The cause of death was a [stroke](/article/en/Stroke) leading to a coma and irreversible cardiovascular collapse. The announcement was made by [Cardinal Kevin Farrell](/article/en/Kevin_Farrell), the camerlengo (papal chamberlain), through a video statement on [Vatican News](/article/en/Vatican_News).

### Funeral and Burial

The nine-day period of mourning ([novendiales](/article/en/Novendiales)) commenced following his death. His body lay in state at [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica) from 23–25 April, during which approximately 250,000 people paid respects.

On **26 April 2025**, a solemn funeral Mass was celebrated in [St. Peter's Square](/article/en/St_Peter's_Square), presided over by [Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re](/article/en/Giovanni_Battista_Re), dean of the [College of Cardinals](/article/en/College_of_Cardinals). Approximately 400,000 people participated—250,000 in the square and 150,000 along the funeral procession route through Rome.

Following the funeral, his remains were carried in procession to the [Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore](/article/en/Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_Maggiore), where he was buried in accordance with his testament (dated 29 June 2022). He became the first pope since [Clement IX](/article/en/Clement_IX) (d. 1669) to be interred in Santa Maria Maggiore rather than in [St. Peter's](/article/en/St_Peter's_Basilica) or the [Vatican grottoes](/article/en/Papal_crypt). The burial reflected his deep devotion to the [Marian](/article/en/Mariology) invocation *Salus Populi Romani* ("Health of the Roman People"), whose icon is housed in that basilica.

### Testament

In his spiritual testament (released upon his death), Francis repeated his wish to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore and requested modest, simple funeral arrangements. The document ended:

> "May the Lord grant a fitting reward to all those who have loved me and who continue to pray for me. The suffering that has marked the final part of my life, I offer to the Lord, for peace in the world and for fraternity among peoples."

## Papal Succession

The 2025 conclave commenced on 7 May 2025. On **8 May 2025**, the cardinal electors elected [**Robert Francis Prevost**](/article/en/Robert_Francis_Prevost) as Francis's successor. Prevost, an American [Augustinian](/article/en/Augustinians) friar and bishop of [Phrygia](/article/en/Phrygia) whom Francis had created cardinal in 2023, took the papal name **[Leo XIV](/article/en/Pope_Leo_XIV)**, becoming the second pope from the Americas after Francis.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Theological Disagreements

#### *Amoris Laetitia* Controversy

Francis's 2016 apostolic exhortation [*Amoris Laetitia*](/article/en/Amoris_Laetitia) sparked significant theological controversy, particularly regarding its approach to divorced and remarried Catholics and access to [sacraments](/article/en/Sacrament).

The text called for "responsible personal and pastoral discernment" rather than categorical rules, stating: "It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church." This language was interpreted by some bishops as permitting communion for remarried divorcees under certain circumstances—a reading that departed from strict [canon law](/article/en/Canon_law) requiring sexual abstinence or an annulment.

In July 2017, four cardinals ([Raymond Burke](/article/en/Raymond_Burke), [Carlo Caffarra](/article/en/Carlo_Caffarra), [Walter Brandmüller](/article/en/Walter_Brandmüller), [Joachim Meisner](/article/en/Joachim_Meisner)) formally submitted five "*dubia*" (doubts) requesting yes/no clarifications from Francis regarding the exhortation's interpretation. Francis never publicly responded to these dubia, maintaining what critics called deliberate ambiguity and what supporters termed pastoral flexibility.

In September 2017, a group of conservative clergy, academics, and laypeople published a "*Correctio Filialis*" ("Filial Correction"), a 25-page document accusing Francis of promoting seven heretical propositions. This represented the first formal correction of a reigning pope since 1333—an extraordinarily rare action.

The controversy divided the episcopate: some bishops implemented restrictive interpretations (excluding remarried divorced from sacraments unless living in continence), while others adopted expansive interpretations (permitting sacramental access following pastoral discernment).

#### *Fiducia Supplicans* and Same-Sex Blessings

On 18 December 2023, Francis approved the declaration [*Fiducia Supplicans*](/article/en/Fiducia_Supplicans) from the [Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith), permitting priests to offer "spontaneous blessings" to same-sex couples and couples in irregular situations without these constituting sacramental validation of the unions.

**Controversy:** Conservative cardinals including [Gerhard Ludwig Müller](/article/en/Gerhard_Ludwig_Müller) called it "sacrilegious and blasphemous." [Cardinal Robert Sarah](/article/en/Robert_Sarah) described it as "a heresy that seriously undermines the Church." In response, 11 African bishops' conferences, represented by [Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo](/article/en/Fridolin_Ambongo), announced they would not implement the declaration in their regions.

**Support:** LGBTQ advocates and progressive Catholics praised it as a meaningful pastoral opening toward inclusion, though noting its limitations regarding actual sacramental recognition of same-sex unions.

#### *Traditionis Custodes* and the Latin Mass

In July 2021, Francis issued the motu proprio [*Traditionis Custodes*](/article/en/Traditionis_Custodes), reversing elements of his predecessor [Benedict XVI's](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) [*Summorum Pontificum*](/article/en/Summorum_Pontificum) (2007), which had liberalized access to the [Traditional Latin Mass](/article/en/Tridentine_Mass) ([extraordinary form](/article/en/Extraordinary_form)).

Under *Traditionis Custodes*:
- Bishops regained authority to grant or suppress use of the Latin Mass in their dioceses
- Newly ordained priests required permission to celebrate the old rite
- Mass communities practicing the extraordinary form faced increased restrictions

**Criticism:** Conservative prelates including Cardinals [Raymond Burke](/article/en/Raymond_Burke), [Gerhard Ludwig Müller](/article/en/Gerhard_Ludwig_Müller), and [Joseph Zen](/article/en/Joseph_Zen) opposed the decree as unnecessarily harsh and implemented with unjustifiable haste. Many traditionalist Catholics felt the restrictions violated their spiritual heritage and [Pope Benedict XVI's](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) more permissive approach.

#### Document on Human Fraternity

The [Document on Human Fraternity](/article/en/Document_on_Human_Fraternity) signed with Grand Imam [Ahmed al-Tayeb](/article/en/Ahmed_al-Tayeb) in Abu Dhabi (4 February 2019) attracted theological criticism, particularly its assertion that "pluralism and diversity of religions, color, sex, race, and language are the will of God in His wisdom."

Catholic theologian [Chad Pecknold](/article/en/Chad_Pecknold) argued this formulation was "puzzling and potentially problematic," potentially suggesting that religious diversity itself is willed by God rather than understood as a consequence of human freedom and sin. [Bishop Athanasius Schneider](/article/en/Athanasius_Schneider) claimed Francis clarified he meant the "permissive will" of God, allowing diversity while preferring Christian unity. The interpretive ambiguity generated debate among Catholic theologians.

### Political Controversies

#### Relations with Donald Trump

Since 2016, Francis and [President Donald Trump](/article/en/Donald_Trump) have been in public disagreement:

- During the 2016 campaign, Francis stated: "A person who thinks only of building walls, of any kind, and not of building bridges, is not a Christian." Trump responded that such criticism from a religious leader was "disgraceful."

- In February 2025, as Trump began mass deportations of migrants, Francis wrote what observers described as "an extraordinary and excoriating response to US bishops," defending migrants and refugees as deserving of fraternal love.

#### China Relations and Religious Freedom

As discussed above, Francis's pursuit of diplomatic normalization with [China](/article/en/China) and the controversial 2018 Vatican-China agreement drew criticism from religious freedom advocates, particularly [Cardinal Joseph Zen](/article/en/Joseph_Zen), who viewed it as compromising Church independence and Catholic religious liberty for diplomatic rapprochement.

#### Relations with Venezuela and Nicaragua

In [Venezuela](/article/en/Venezuela), Francis declined to openly condemn [President Nicolás Maduro](/article/en/Nicolás_Maduro) despite pressure from local bishops and opposition figures, pursuing instead a mediation role that critics felt enabled authoritarianism.

In [Nicaragua](/article/en/Nicaragua), tensions escalated between Francis and [President Daniel Ortega](/article/en/Daniel_Ortega), who persecuted the Catholic Church and imprisoned bishops including [Rolando Álvarez](/article/en/Rolando_Álvarez). In March 2023, Nicaragua suspended diplomatic relations with the Vatican in response to Francis's criticism of Ortega's regime as reminiscent of "communist or Hitlerian dictatorships."

#### Ukraine War Neutrality

As discussed extensively above, Francis's reluctance to directly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, his suggestions about NATO's provocative role, and his focus on dialogue rather than clear attribution of aggression frustrated many Ukrainians and Western leaders, who perceived his approach as morally ambiguous.

## Legacy and Historical Assessment

As of 2025, assessments of Francis's thirteen-year pontificate remain contested along ideological lines:

### Achievements and Positive Contributions

**Reformist vision:** Francis fundamentally reoriented the Church toward the peripheries—the poor, marginalized, LGBTQ persons, refugees—and elevated mercy and pastoral accompaniment as central theological values.

**Institutional transformation:** Through curial reform, financial transparency initiatives, cardinal appointments, and synodal processes, he initiated structural changes toward decentralization, lay participation, and missionary outreach.

**Environmental leadership:** *Laudato Si'* and subsequent writings positioned the Catholic Church as an institutional voice for climate action and ecological justice.

**Interreligious dialogue:** Francis advanced unprecedented levels of dialogue with Islam, Orthodox Christianity, and other faiths, emphasizing shared values and common humanity.

**Abuse accountability:** Despite inconsistencies, Francis implemented institutional reforms making mandatory reporting, victim protection, and perpetrator accountability Church policy.

**Accessibility and communication:** Francis's media presence, accessible language, and personal humility made Catholicism more relatable to contemporary populations.

### Criticisms and Limitations

**Theological ambiguity:** Critics argue Francis employed deliberately ambiguous language on contested issues (Amoris Laetitia, gender ideology), allowing multiple interpretations and potentially enabling doctrinal confusion.

**Insufficient structural change:** While initiating reforms, Francis maintained core traditional doctrines on women's ordination, clerical celibacy, and contraception, limiting the scope of transformation some sought.

**Diplomatic compromises:** His pursuit of Vatican diplomatic goals (China relations, Ukraine mediation) sometimes appeared to compromise prophetic witness on religious freedom and human rights.

**Incomplete abuse response:** Despite reforms, the Church continued protecting some abusers, reassigning complicit bishops, and relying on statute of limitations defenses, failing to satisfy survivor advocates.

**Declining Catholicism:** During Francis's papacy, Catholic adherence in traditionally Catholic regions ([Europe](/article/en/Europe), [Latin America](/article/en/Latin_America)) continued declining, raising questions about whether his pastoral approach effectively addressed secularization.

**Age and health:** His advancing age and health challenges in final years limited his availability and effectiveness in directly driving reform.

### Comparative Historical Position

Francis is likely to be remembered as a transitional pope who fundamentally altered the tone and priorities of the papal office while working within traditional institutional and doctrinal constraints. His emphasis on mercy, option for the poor, environmental stewardship, and inclusive dialogue shifted Catholic identity and practice in significant ways. Yet his reluctance to undertake more radical structural reforms (women's ordination, married clergy, contraception) and his diplomatic pragmatism disappointed those seeking more comprehensive transformation.

Historical judgment may ultimately depend on whether the structural and attitudinal changes he initiated prove sustainable and generative in subsequent pontificates, or whether they represent an anomalous period of reform interrupted by more conservative successors.
