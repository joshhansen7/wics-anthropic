# È sempre Cartabianca

*È sempre Cartabianca* is an Italian television talk show hosted by [Bianca Berlinguer](/article/en/Bianca_Berlinguer) that airs on [Rete 4](/article/en/Rete_4), owned by [Mediaset](/article/en/Mediaset). The program began airing on September 5, 2023, following Berlinguer's move from [RAI](/article/en/RAI) to Mediaset. It is a continuation of the former [Rai 3](/article/en/Rai_3) program [Cartabianca](/article/en/Cartabianca), which ended on June 27, 2023.

The show features political discussions, current events, and regular appearances by Italian writer, mountaineer and sculptor [Mauro Corona](/article/en/Mauro_Corona), who provides commentary on topics of the week.

## History

*È sempre Cartabianca* was created as a direct continuation of *Cartabianca*, which had aired on Rai 3 from 2016 to 2023. When Bianca Berlinguer decided to leave the state broadcaster RAI after 34 years to join the private network Mediaset, she brought the concept of her show with her, though with a slightly modified name.

The name *È sempre Cartabianca* (meaning "It's always Cartabianca") was chosen to maintain continuity with the previous program while acknowledging the change in network. The show maintained a similar format, topics, and many of the same regular guests, including Mauro Corona, whose controversial appearances had become a signature element of the original program.

## Format

The program follows a talk show format focusing on political and social issues in Italy. Each episode begins with a segment featuring Mauro Corona, who provides commentary on current events or societal observations from his perspective as a writer connected to nature and traditional rural life.

Following Corona's segment, Berlinguer hosts panel discussions with politicians, journalists, and experts on various topics of national interest. The show aims to present different perspectives on controversial issues while maintaining journalistic standards.

## Mauro Corona's role

Mauro Corona's regular appearances on both *Cartabianca* and *È sempre Cartabianca* have been a defining feature of the programs. His role began on September 11, 2018, when he was invited as a regular guest on *Cartabianca* at the beginning of each episode to comment on current events.

Corona's relationship with the program has had its controversies. He was temporarily suspended twice from *Cartabianca*:

1. In June 2019, after drinking an alcoholic beverage on live television to celebrate a friend's birthday
2. More significantly, on September 23, 2020, after calling Berlinguer a "hen" during an on-air argument

The second suspension lasted an entire season, during which Corona appeared on Paolo Del Debbio's talk show "Dritto e rovescio" on Mediaset. He returned to *Cartabianca* in 2021 and remained until the show ended in June 2023, subsequently following Berlinguer to *È sempre Cartabianca* on Rete 4.

## Reception

The program has maintained a significant audience following its move to Mediaset, with Corona's segments often generating social media attention and public discussion. The show's blend of political analysis and Corona's more philosophical, nature-based perspectives has created a distinctive format in the Italian television landscape.

The program has been both praised for its willingness to include diverse voices and criticized for occasional heated exchanges that some viewers consider more entertainment than substantive debate.

## Controversies

Beyond Corona's suspensions, the show has faced scrutiny regarding the balance of political viewpoints represented and the management of confrontational discussions between guests. The move from public broadcasting to a private network also sparked discussions about potential changes in editorial approach and political positioning.
