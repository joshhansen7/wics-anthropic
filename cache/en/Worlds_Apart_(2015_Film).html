# Worlds Apart

**Worlds Apart** (Greek: **Ένας άλλος κόσμος**, literal translation: "Another World") is a 2015 Greek drama film directed by [Christopher Papakaliatis](/article/en/Christopher_Papakaliatis). It consists of three separate narratives, each following a love story between a foreigner and a Greek. Each story represents a different generation falling in love during a time of socioeconomic turmoil that dominates Southern Europe as a whole, only to connect as a single story in the end. The film addresses issues such as the [refugee crisis](/article/en/European_migrant_crisis), the [economic crisis](/article/en/European_debt_crisis), and the general social landscape of Greece in 2015.

The film was Papakaliatis's second directorial attempt, following his first film "[What If...](/article/en/What_If..._(2012_film))". It was distributed internationally under the English title "Worlds Apart," while in some countries it was known by different titles (such as "Greek Love" in Israel and "My Love, Greece" in South Korea).

## Plot

The film consists of three love stories that develop in [Athens](/article/en/Athens) during [Holy Week](/article/en/Holy_Week) before Easter. This timing is reflected in traditional processions passing in each of the chapters. The processions are held on [Good Friday](/article/en/Good_Friday) evening at the end of the week, symbolizing Jesus' path of suffering towards his crucifixion. The marchers sing the song "Ω! Γλυκύ Μου Έαρ" (transliteration: O! Gliki Mou Ear; in English: "Oh! My Sweet Spring").

### First Chapter: "Boomerang"

Daphne is a political science student at the [University of Athens](/article/en/National_and_Kapodistrian_University_of_Athens), and Fares is a Syrian-Christian refugee who was an art student in his country and came to Athens to emigrate to Canada. He tries to acquire a fake passport and makes a living as a street vendor offering cheap bargains to drivers on the road. The two meet when Fares rescues Daphne from attackers in a dark alley at night, and when he happens to see her on a bus, Fares returns Daphne's mobile phone that she dropped while fleeing, and they fall in love.

Adonis, Daphne's father, is a xenophobic racist who blames immigrants, the government, and insurance companies for the collapse of his chain of stores. Believing that all immigrants should be removed from Greece, Adonis is active in a gang of extremist thugs who conduct pogroms against illegal immigrants. While driving through the streets of Athens, an immigrant tries to sell him a boomerang. Adonis attacks the immigrant with shouts, and the latter flees leaving the boomerang in Adonis's hands. He is forced to sell his car, sits disgruntled by the seashore and throws the boomerang in frustration, which returns to him. Daphne leaves home against her father's wishes, who doesn't know about her romance with an Arab refugee, and she spends most of her time with Fares who lives with many illegal immigrants in Athens' old abandoned airport. Fares receives his new passport but decides to stay in Athens and doesn't board the train with his refugee friends.

Adonis and his friends arm themselves with firearms, go out one night to attack the immigrants staying at the airport, and open fire everywhere. Daphne and Fares, sleeping in an abandoned plane, flee together with all the foreigners, and Daphne and Adonis encounter each other, to the shock of both.

### Second Chapter: "Loseft 50mg"

Yorgos Angelou is a marketing manager at a company in Athens, married with a child named Adonis. His marriage is deteriorating due to financial difficulties, so he takes Loseft anti-depression pills. Meanwhile, Elise from Sweden arrives in Athens on business and stays in a rented apartment in the "[Plaka](/article/en/Plaka)" district. Yorgos and Elise meet by chance in a bar near her apartment, fall in love, and begin to have romantic meetings. In conversations about the economic situation, Yorgos complains that people who lose their world are blamed for their own suffering, but Elise advocates for a free market world where each person is responsible for their own fate.

One day, Elise arrives at the offices of the company where Yorgos works, and it turns out that she is a senior manager who came to implement efficiency measures and workforce reduction before foreign investors take over the Greek company. The two are forced to act as strangers toward their environment, but their love and work relationship interfere with each other. Another employee at the company, Odysseus, an accountant and close friend of Yorgos, comes to plead with him to prevent his dismissal because he, Odysseus, is in financial difficulties, his house has been foreclosed, and his wife is pregnant. Yorgos tries to discuss this with Elise, but she rejects him because his approach is unethical. More and more employees are fired, and finally Odysseus too. As a defiance against Elise, Yorgos brings his wife Anna and son to the office. Elise finds it difficult to do her job when she needs to deal with Yorgos's department, and the superiors express resentment that the cuts are not progressing.

A manager in the company, Ilias, who learned about Yorgos's affair with Elise, taunts him about being immune from dismissal because of it, and tells him that Odysseus committed suicide and his wife refuses to see Yorgos at the funeral. Yorgos breaks down and tells Elise that their romance is over, and now she is dealing with the investors' demand to also close Yorgos's department.

### Third Chapter: "Second Chance"

Sebastian Zimmer is a German historian and lecturer who has retired, a confirmed bachelor who moved to live in Athens and serves as an advisor in the [National Library of Greece](/article/en/National_Library_of_Greece). While shopping at a supermarket, he asks for Maria's help, and she complains that as a foreigner he buys all kinds of goods, while she as a local has no money to buy even feta cheese and cherry tomatoes, and she comes to the supermarket out of habit, but hardly buys anything. Sebastian invites Maria for coffee, and she says that she is married, a mother of children and unhappy, but Sebastian believes that a person can change their fate. He begins to court her, buys her a box of cherry tomatoes, and they begin to meet regularly at the supermarket, as Maria is afraid to meet in other places. Sebastian bribes the supermarket guard, who allows him to enter the place after closing time, as a form of entertainment.

Maria accepts Sebastian's offer to come with him to the National Library, where he gives her books to read. One of these is a mythology book about the love story of [Eros and Psyche](/article/en/Cupid_and_Psyche). Sebastian tells Maria how Psyche went to the underworld to search for her beloved Eros, and how Zeus gave their love a second chance. Meanwhile, the camera jumps to the two previous chapters in the film as an analogy to the mythological story. Later, he gives her a book called "Second Chance," and Maria talks about her fears regarding her grandson's upcoming birthday, because after the joy she will remain with her unhappiness and doubts about her ability to correct her life's mistakes. One evening Maria stops showing up for meetings at the supermarket.

### Epilogue

Images from the grandson's birthday dinner are shown, and from here on the connections between the stories and characters are revealed: Maria and Adonis are the parents of siblings Yorgos and Daphne, and the grandparents of grandson Adonis (named after his grandfather), Yorgos's son. Maria was afraid of Adonis's reaction if he found out about Daphne's love for the Syrian refugee Fares, which is why Daphne ran away from home. Adonis scolded Yorgos about his love affair and demanded that he maintain his family's integrity. One evening, Adonis returned with bloodstains on his shirt. Maria understood what he was doing; he shouted at her that the immigrants sleep at the airport, deal in weapons and drugs, and rob shops, while he fulfills his duty to the country and his children. Maria accuses him of being a violent fascist, spits in his face, and prepares to leave the house. Adonis's partner calls him, and they go out to attack the refugees at the airport, as described in the first chapter. Daphne and Fares encounter Adonis during the pogrom, and then Adonis's partner shoots her, and she dies in her father's arms, before Fares's eyes. Here, the symbolism of the boomerang becomes clear, as Adonis's hatred of foreigners came back to him like a boomerang with his daughter's death. Maria received news of Daphne's death while packing a suitcase, and then stopped coming to meetings with Sebastian. Elise asks her employers to send her a replacement and returns to Sweden without saying goodbye to Yorgos, who is eventually fired too and separates from his wife.

After a year, Fares arrives as a refugee in Canada. Yorgos accidentally finds the book "Second Chance" with a dedication written by Sebastian to Maria, and comes with the book to the National Library to meet Sebastian. The latter tells him that he has not stopped waiting for Maria during this year, and goes to meet Maria who is now destitute, as a fulfillment of the promise of a second chance.

Similarly, he traveled to countries such as Cyprus, Switzerland, Austria, USA (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago), where he attended film premieres and held discussions with audiences, as part of promoting and communicating Greece through Greek cinema.

## Reception

On [Rotten Tomatoes](/article/en/Rotten_Tomatoes) the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 9 reviews. On [Metacritic](/article/en/Metacritic), it has a score of 61 based on 5 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

Frank Scheck of [The Hollywood Reporter](/article/en/The_Hollywood_Reporter) wrote: "Worlds Apart doesn't manage to transcend the forced and familiar-feeling aspects of its multipart narrative, but it does offer an evocative portrait of its troubled milieu, and one of its segments, at least, has genuine emotional resonance." Scheck notes that only the third story manages to evoke genuine emotion, as the film benefits from Simmons' presence as the retired professor, while Kavoyianni rises above the reasonable acting in the film, as the unhappy housewife. In contrast, the other two stories are, according to Scheck, clichés, one - of the "Romeo and Juliet" formula, and the other - of give and take relationships.

Owen Gleiberman of [Variety](/article/en/Variety_(magazine)) wrote: "It isn't bad, but it's kind of a trifle. Though it treats its themes with reasonable honesty, it can't help but come off as a bit diagrammed." Unlike Scheck, Gleiberman thought that the second chapter is the most resonant, as Yorgos stands by in the face of tears and despair, and the question is whether he will manage to save his skin on one hand, but on the other hand - to free himself, and it is clear that the disaster of those fired is the fear of falling between the cracks, and nothing awaits them but doom.

Gary Goldstein wrote in the [Los Angeles Times](/article/en/Los_Angeles_Times) that it is an artistic drama, where the stories intertwine in a surprising and convincing way, and Papakaliatis manages to balance them emotionally, culturally, and politically.

Simon Abrams praised Simmons and Kavoyianni, who in a skilled performance, convey a world of meanings with just a look. These, unlike the other actors, whom Abrams thought lacked the chemistry that makes viewers believe that the connections between the characters cross socio-economic boundaries.

In Israel, Shmulik Duvdevani wrote in [Ynet](/article/en/Ynet) that the legendary-topical dimension in the three love stories collapses in the face of political naivety and stereotypical design of the characters. According to Duvdevani, "This film is an example of how a real crisis is exploited for the purposes of melodramatic kitsch and political and human flattening."

## Awards and Nominations

At the 2016 [Hellenic Film Academy Awards](/article/en/Hellenic_Film_Academy_Awards) ceremony, the film won the Best Supporting Actor award (Minas Hatzisavvas), and also received three nominations: Best Film (Kostas Soussalas, Christopher Papakaliatis), Best Actress (Maria Kavoyianni), and Best Production Design (Yorgos Georgiou).
