# Family Lexicon

**Family Lexicon** (original Italian title: *Lessico famigliare*) is an autobiographical novel by Italian author [Natalia Ginzburg](/article/en/Natalia_Ginzburg), first published by [Einaudi](/article/en/Einaudi) in 1963. The book won the prestigious [Strega Prize](/article/en/Strega_Prize) that same year and has been translated into numerous languages, including English, Catalan, Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. In English, it has been published under various titles: "Family Sayings," "The Things We Used to Say," and "Family Lexicon."

## Overview

The novel is a semi-biographical account of Ginzburg's family life in [Turin](/article/en/Turin) from the 1920s to the early 1950s. It portrays the daily life of the [Levi-Tanzi family](/article/en/Levi-Tanzi_(family)), dominated by the figure of her father, Giuseppe Levi, a renowned histologist and professor of anatomy with socialist and anti-fascist connections. 

The book takes its title from the unique expressions, phrases, and linguistic patterns that were common within the family home—their own private "lexicon." Ginzburg initially intended to write a short story about this family language but expanded it to include the broader family history that gave rise to this unique lexicon.

The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of significant historical events in Italy: the [fascist regime](/article/en/Italian_Fascism) of the 1930s, [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II), the persecution of Jews in Italy, and the post-war period, including the disillusionment that followed the failure to achieve the aims of the wartime resistance movement.

## Plot

The novel describes the daily life of the Levi-Tanzi family through their habits, behaviors, and especially their linguistic communication patterns. Figures and events follow one another without hierarchical order, presented through their gestures and words. The narrative is written in a continuous flow without chapter divisions.

The book chronicles family anecdotes interwoven with profound reflections, set against the backdrop of fascist Italy. This historical context runs parallel to the family story, providing a sinister background to otherwise ordinary domestic scenes.

As the narrative progresses, the author's character becomes more prominent. Already married, she describes her activities at the [Einaudi publishing house](/article/en/Giulio_Einaudi_Editore) that she helped establish alongside other writers and intellectuals, and reflects on the craft of writing.

The novel also covers dramatic events of the time, particularly during the fascist period and in post-war Italy. These include the impact of the fascist racial laws, Ginzburg's confinement in [Abruzzo](/article/en/Abruzzo), the murder of her husband [Leone Ginzburg](/article/en/Leone_Ginzburg) for anti-fascist political activity, and the suicide of writer [Cesare Pavese](/article/en/Cesare_Pavese) in 1950, which marked the collapse of the illusions fostered by the Resistance.

## Characters

The principal characters in the novel are members of Ginzburg's immediate family:

- **Giuseppe Levi**: The father, a professor of anatomy connected to Socialist and anti-Fascist circles in Italy. He is portrayed as the dominant figure in the family, never satisfied with his children's behavior.

- **Lidia**: The mother, described as curious and sociable with well-formed political opinions and sympathy for socialism. In everyday life, she yields to her husband's authority.

- **Gino**: The eldest brother, who follows the path his father set for him.

- **Paola**: The sister who resembles her mother in character and marries [Adriano Olivetti](/article/en/Adriano_Olivetti), the owner of the [Olivetti company](/article/en/Olivetti).

- **Mario**: The brother who was active in the anti-Fascist movement, fled to France and settled there.

- **Alberto**: The brother who worried his parents in his youth as someone not focused on studies, but later became a successful doctor.

- **Natalia**: The author herself, the youngest child in the family.

In addition to the members of the nuclear family, the book recalls numerous characters belonging to the maternal (Tanzi) and paternal (Levi) families, as well as figures linked by friendship or professional relationships with family members. Among these are many notable intellectuals and political figures of the time, including [Filippo Turati](/article/en/Filippo_Turati), founder of the Italian Socialist movement, whom the family sheltered during his escape to France in 1926.

## Literary style and themes

The book is written in Ginzburg's characteristically restrained and unemotional style, with an ironic yet sympathetic tone. It represents a kind of daily inventory of the household lexicon, capable of evoking the meanings and memories associated with it.

Israeli scholar and editor Menachem Perry has noted that [Marcel Proust](/article/en/Marcel_Proust) and his work "[In Search of Lost Time](/article/en/In_Search_of_Lost_Time)" stand in the background of this work. According to Perry, the book "is the sharpest challenge I know to the elitist and poetic Proustian 'memory,' a type of memory that only Proust is capable of. Against it, Ginzburg presents a family and democratic memory of everyday people, which comes back to life around cheerful expressions, and no less around the fullness of peripheral details."

A significant theme in the novel is the anti-fascist sentiment shared by all family members, with some actively involved in the Socialist and Communist movements in Italy. The book describes many meetings between family members and central figures in the literary and ideological fields of these movements.

## Reception and criticism

While the book was never a bestseller, it has received hundreds of reviews and several reprints. It is considered by many to be the narrative pinnacle of Natalia Ginzburg's literary production and one of the cornerstones of Italian literature of the 1960s. The 2010 Italian edition includes an introduction by literary critic [Cesare Segre](/article/en/Cesare_Segre).
