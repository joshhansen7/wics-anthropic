# Clostridioides difficile

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile until 2016) is a species of anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium. It is known also as C. difficile, or C. diff, and is a major human pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, particularly in healthcare settings. The bacterium was transferred from the genus [Clostridium](/article/en/Clostridium) to the genus [Clostridioides](/article/en/Clostridioides) in 2016, based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic classifications, though the common abbreviation "C. diff" remains in use.

## Taxonomy

The species was transferred from the genus Clostridium to Clostridioides in 2016, thus giving it the binomial Clostridioides difficile. This new name reflects the taxonomic differences between this species and members of the genus Clostridium, while maintaining the common name as C. difficile. As of 2018, the only other species in this new genus is Clostridioides mangenotii (formerly known as Clostridium mangenotii).

C. difficile was first described in 1935 by Hall and O'Toole, who studied the normal intestinal flora in infants. They discovered a frequently present organism in over 50% of healthy infants, but not in adults. Since the examined infants showed no signs of illness, C. difficile (initially called "Bacillus difficilus") was considered harmless. The specific epithet "difficile" comes from Latin meaning "difficult," referring to the great difficulties the scientists experienced in isolating it and its very slow growth in culture media.

## Microbiology

### Morphology and characteristics

Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive, rod-shaped (bacillus), pleomorphic bacterium measuring 0.5-1.9 × 3.0 × 16.9μm. Under the microscope, cells appear as long, irregular (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) with a bulge at their terminal ends due to subterminal spore formation. The bacterium possesses peritrichous flagella making it motile.

C. difficile is strictly anaerobic, meaning it cannot grow in the presence of oxygen. It shows optimum growth on blood agar at human body temperatures (37°C) in anaerobic conditions. The bacterium is catalase- and superoxide dismutase-negative.

C. difficile is ubiquitous in nature and especially prevalent in soil, feces of domestic animals and humans, sewage, hay, sand, and retail meat. Its vegetative cells are sensitive to environmental conditions, but under stress, the bacterium produces spores that are resistant to heat, acids, bases, and many disinfectants including alcohol-based sanitizers, allowing long-term survival in harsh environments.

### Genome and epigenome

The first complete genome sequence of a C. difficile strain was published in 2005 by the Sanger Institute in the UK. This was of strain 630, a virulent and multiple drug-resistant strain isolated in Switzerland in 1982. By 2010, scientists at the Sanger Institute had sequenced genomes of about 30 C. difficile isolates.

Researchers at McGill University in Montreal sequenced the genome of the highly virulent Quebec strain of C. difficile in 2005 using ultra-high throughput sequencing technology. In 2012, scientists at University of Oxford sequenced C. difficile genomes from 486 cases arising over four years in Oxfordshire using next-generation sequencing technologies.

C. difficile has a highly diverse epigenome, with 17 high-quality methylation motifs reported so far, the majority pertaining to the 6mA type. Methylation at one of these motifs - CAAAAA, was shown to impact sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation, and host colonization.

At least eight mainly temperate bacteriophages have been isolated from C. difficile, ranging in genome size from about 30 to about 60 kbp. Both environmentally and clinically derived C. difficile strains carry a diverse and prevalent set of prophages.

## Virulence factors

### Toxins

Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce multiple toxins, which are the main virulence factors:

1. **Toxin A (TcdA)** - An enterotoxin with a molecular weight of 308 kDa that shows intestinal loop activity.

2. **Toxin B (TcdB)** - A cytotoxin with a molecular weight of 270 kDa that shows strong cytotoxicity.

3. **Binary toxin (CDT)** - Present in some strains, though its role in disease is not fully understood.

Both toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. They modify Rho proteins and jointly damage the actin cytoskeleton of intestinal epithelial cells, leading to cell death. The toxins also induce the production of cytokines such as IL-8, triggering neutrophil inflammation.

The genes expressing toxins A and B, known as tcdA and tcdB respectively, exist adjacently in a genetic region called PaLoc (Pathogenicity Locus). PaLoc also contains tcdD (positive regulator), tcdE (hokkin-like protein), and tcdC (negative regulator). Non-toxigenic strains lack the PaLoc region.

The receptors for toxin A and toxin B are gp96 and chondroitin sulfated proteoglycan 4, respectively. The binary toxin CDT consists of CDTa with ADP-ribosylation toxin activity and CDTb, a binding site that uses LSR (Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor) as a receptor.

### Other virulence factors

Additional virulence factors include:

- An adhesion factor that mediates binding to human colonic cells
- A hyaluronidase
- Production of the chemical para-cresol, which inhibits the growth of other microbes in its vicinity and allows it to outcompete normal human gut flora
- The S-layer, a chain mail-like armor that may be responsible for C. difficile's apparent immunity to antibiotic treatments, human saliva, and lysozyme

## Epidemiology

According to the CDC, in 2017 there were 223,900 cases in hospitalized patients and 12,800 deaths in the United States. A 2015 CDC study estimated that C. difficile afflicted almost half a million Americans and caused 29,000 deaths in 2011. The study estimated that 40% of cases began in nursing homes or community health-care settings, while 24% occurred in hospitals.

This epidemic is considered one of the most severe of the early 21st century, killing between 60,000 and 100,000 people annually worldwide. Its incidence has nearly tripled in the United States in a decade, with an estimated rate of 84 per 100,000. The severity also tends to increase with rising mortality. The annual cost of C. difficile management in the US is estimated to exceed five billion dollars.

Although C. difficile is known as a hospital- and antibiotic-associated pathogen, at most one-third of infections can be traced to transmission from an infected person in hospitals. Most infections are acquired outside of hospitals, and many risk factors other than antibiotics can contribute to infection.

### Carriage rates

C. difficile can be found in the intestines of healthy individuals without causing disease:
- Infants and young children: Up to 80% of infants have C. difficile in their intestines, with approximately 50% of 12-month-old infants being carriers
- Children over 2 years old: About 3%
- Healthy adults: 1.9-5% (with variations by country; for example, 15.4% in Japan)
- Hospitalized patients: Colonization increases to approximately 20-40% after hospital admission

While early estimates indicated that C. difficile was present in 2–5% of the adult population, later research indicated that colonization is closely associated with a history of unrelated diarrheal illnesses, such as food poisoning or laxative abuse. Individuals with no history of gastrointestinal disturbances appear unlikely to become asymptomatic carriers.

## Transmission and infection

C. difficile is transmitted from person or animal to person by the fecal-oral route, shed in feces. The organism forms heat-resistant, aerotolerant spores that are resistant to alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. The spores can survive on surfaces in clinical environments for long periods.

Any surface, device, or material (e.g., toilets, bathing tubs, or rectal thermometers) that becomes contaminated with feces may serve as a reservoir for C. difficile spores. Once spores are ingested, their acid resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. They germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon upon exposure to bile acids.

The germination of spores depends on several co-factors, including the presence of glycine and various bile salts. Primary bile acids (produced by the liver and delivered to the digestive tract) stimulate germination, while secondary bile acids (modified by the microbiota bacteria) inhibit it. The loss of a large part of the digestive bacteria, typically during antibiotic therapy, can increase the proportion of primary bile acids and thus enhance the germination of C. difficile.

Susceptibility to colonization appears to be triggered by diarrheal illnesses, such as food poisoning, [Crohn's disease](/article/en/Crohn's_disease) or laxative abuse. Once people are colonized by C. difficile, they remain carriers for year-long time scales, but the day-to-day abundance of C. difficile fluctuates considerably – from being below the limit of detection to high levels of shedding from one day to the next. GI disturbances in carriers appear to trigger periods of increased shedding, which may be an important factor for transmission.

Sporulation was shown to be significantly reduced after inactivation of C. difficile's DNA methyltransferase CamA, raising the prospect of developing a drug that may inhibit this bacterium in a specific manner.

### Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of developing C. difficile infection (CDI):

- **Antibiotic use**: Especially broad-spectrum antibiotics like clindamycin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and ampicillins, which disrupt the normal gut flora
- **Advanced age**: Particularly over 65 years
- **Healthcare exposure**: Hospital or nursing home stays
- **Gastrointestinal procedures or surgery**
- **Immunosuppression**: Including use of immunosuppressants
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: May increase the risk of primary infection and recurrence
- **Hypogammaglobulinemia**: Low antibody levels
- **Hypoalbuminemia**: Low albumin levels, possibly related to the potential chelating ability of serum albumin in relation to toxin B
- **Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs**
- **Intestinal-damaging chemo or radiation therapy**
- **Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases**
- **Diabetes mellitus**
- **Chronic kidney disease**
- **Antidepressant use**: Particularly in elderly hospitalized patients with comorbidities
- **Depression**
- **Dementia**

## Clinical manifestations

### Signs and symptoms

Symptoms of C. difficile infection include:
- Watery diarrhea (at least three loose bowel movements a day) with a characteristic putrid odor
- Dehydration
- Abdominal pain, which can be severe
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea
- Fever

The severity of CDI can range from mild diarrhea to severe complications:

1. **Mild to moderate infection**: Watery diarrhea with abdominal discomfort
   
2. **Pseudomembranous colitis**: A severe form of intestinal inflammation with exudation of fibrin from the inflamed intestinal wall, which combines with granulocytes and destroyed intestinal cells to form a white layer (pseudomembrane) on the intestinal wall

3. **Toxic megacolon**: A severe form of colonic distention characterized by relaxation and grotesque expansion of the intestine. This section of the colon has strong multiplication of C. difficile, leading to dissolution of the intestinal walls

4. **Complications**: Intestinal perforation, sepsis, and death

## Pathophysiology

C. difficile is transmitted through the oral-fecal route, and many reproduce through spores. The pathogenesis involves several steps:

1. **Ingestion of spores**: Spores are ingested and pass through the stomach unharmed due to their acid resistance

2. **Germination**: Spore germination depends on the ability to sense primary bile acids in the liver, like taurocholate, which are sensed by the germinant receptor CspC. Secondary bile acids can inhibit these processes in the colon

3. **Colonization**: Spores can grow and colonize the intestine, especially after antibiotic-induced shifts in the host microbiota

4. **Adhesion and penetration**: C. difficile secretes mucolytic enzymes like CWp84 to degrade the colonic mucosa. The spores can adhere to colon cells

5. **Toxin production**: Toxigenic strains produce toxins A and B, which enter intestinal epithelial cells

6. **Cell damage**: The toxins inactivate small GTP-binding Rho proteins, leading to actin depolymerization, destroying the integrity of the cytoskeleton. This results in cell pathology (rounding) and leads to caspase-3 and 9 mediated apoptosis

7. **Inflammation**: The toxins activate TLR-4 and 5, promoting the production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α), causing severe intestinal inflammation

8. **Increased permeability**: The destruction of epithelial tight junctions increases intestinal permeability, causing diarrhea and allowing bacterial components to enter the bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic inflammation

The bacterium is also motile and can switch between motile and sessile phases, a process regulated by cyclic-di-GMP. C. difficile is capable of forming biofilms and engaging in cell-to-cell signaling.

### Immune response

The C. difficile secreted toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) contain immunogenic antigens that are recognized by antibodies and T cells. However, the levels of anti-TcdA and -TcdB IgG antibodies have not been able to discriminate healthy individuals from patients with C. difficile infection, meaning they have limited clinical use.

Recent work has shown these toxins are also recognized by helper CD4+ T cells, predominantly by the Th17 helper cells, which are important in maintaining a healthy gut environment, although in patients with severe infection these cells are impaired. Individuals with severe C. difficile infection had significantly more toxin-specific T cells compared to those with mild infection, indicating T cells are playing a key role in fighting this infection.

This immune response can further dysregulate microRNA expression. The recovery of the toxin-specific Th17 cells and microRNA expression following fecal microbiota transplant in patients with severe disease supports this relationship.

New findings show that the loss of the interleukin-10 corresponds to higher levels of interleukin-22, which has been found to be important in a host's response to a C. difficile infection. Thus, IL-10 deficiency can increase a host's defense against the pathogen, which could be of particular interest in future research for treatments.

## Possible role in colon cancer

Studies indicate that C. difficile infection may contribute to [colorectal cancer](/article/en/Colorectal_cancer) development through several mechanisms:

1. **Chronic inflammation and epithelial barrier disruption**: The inflammatory environment created by C. difficile infection may promote cancer development

2. **Tumor promotion**: Toxigenic C. difficile strains isolated from human colon tumors have been shown to drive colonic tumorigenesis in mice, with tumor growth requiring toxin B (TcdB) and accompanied by activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inflammatory immune responses

3. **Cellular senescence**: C. difficile toxins can induce cellular senescence; TcdB-triggered senescent cells may promote neoplastic transformation via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype

4. **Epithelial-mesenchymal transition**: C. difficile releases membrane vesicles that directly stimulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition in colonic epithelial cells, as evidenced by upregulation of β-catenin and mesenchymal markers with loss of E-cadherin in both cell cultures and mouse models, thus creating a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment in the colon

## Diagnosis

An infection with C. difficile is often indicated by foul-smelling diarrhea, and a recent history of antibiotic treatment can also point to Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD). Clinical diagnosis requires either the detection of the toxins in the stool or direct cultivation of C. difficile.

Diagnostic methods include:

1. **Cytotoxin assay**: Detects cell toxin B (ToxB) cytotoxicity in fecal eluate. The presence of C. difficile toxin is confirmed by the neutralization of the cytotoxic effect with anti-toxin antibodies

2. **Toxigenic stool culture**: C. difficile strains can be cultured before conducting a cytotoxin assay to detect toxin-producing strains

3. **Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs)**: More widely used due to their rapid turnaround, low cost, and simplicity, although they have lower sensitivity than toxigenic stool cultures

4. **PCR-based assays**: Have a shorter turnaround time and a higher sensitivity range than toxigenic stool culture, helping to avoid detection of asymptomatic patients

5. **Endoscopy**: Pseudomembranous colitis can be diagnosed by intestinal endoscopy (colonoscopy)

6. **Imaging**: Abdominal CT scan can show thickening of the colon, sometimes with nodules or ascites

## Treatment

The treatment of C. difficile infection revolves around several approaches:

### Antibiotics

Patients being treated with antibiotics when symptoms begin should stop taking them, if possible. This break in antibiotic therapy can sometimes lead to spontaneous resolution of symptoms.

For those requiring treatment:

- **Primary infections** are typically treated with oral vancomycin, with a usual dosage of 125 mg every 6 hours. This has replaced metronidazole as the first-line treatment due to greater efficacy, safety profile, and lower recurrence rates

- **Alternative treatments** include fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily for 10 days), which has similar efficacy and even lower recurrence rates than vancomycin, though it is more expensive

- **Severe infections** may be treated with adjuvant therapy of parenteral metronidazole plus oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin

- **Recurrent infections**: Approximately 15-30% of patients who complete therapy for primary infection will experience a relapse
  - First recurrence is usually treated with the same antibiotic used for the primary infection
  - Subsequent recurrences should not be treated with metronidazole
  - A vancomycin taper (decreasing doses over up to 3 months) may be used for cases that don't respond to standard treatment
  - Long-term treatment with a vancomycin taper supplemented with probiotics, especially [Saccharomyces boulardii](/article/en/Saccharomyces_boulardii), is associated with higher success rates

- **Multiple recurrences** may be treated with oral fidaxomicin or other approaches
  - For deteriorating patients or those progressing to severe-complicated disease, the addition of intravenous tigecycline may be beneficial
  - Patients with high risk of relapse may benefit from the addition of the monoclonal antibody bezlotoxumab to the standard of care

### Fecal microbiota transplantation

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring stool from a healthy person to the colon of a patient with recurrent CDI. This approach has proven highly effective:

- Success rate of approximately 90-93% for severe CDI
- Low recurrence rates (around 19%)
- Effective and safe for children and young adults
- Can be administered via colonoscopy, enema, or in pill form

The state of the host immune system is important when considering the success of microbiota-based treatments in clearing infection. Possible side effects include flares of inflammatory bowel disease in some cases.

In April 2023, the FDA approved the first oral microbiome therapeutic, VOWST, for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

### Other treatments

- **Supportive care**: Rehydration (oral or intravenous) to replace fluid losses from diarrhea
- **Avoid antiperistaltic antidiarrheals**: Medications such as loperamide can paradoxically worsen the infection and should be avoided
- **Cholestyramine**: Has been proposed to bind toxins
- **Surgical intervention**: In severe cases, particularly toxic megacolon, removal of the infected part of the colon (colectomy) may be necessary to prevent perforation, sepsis, and death

## Prevention

Prevention of C. difficile infection focuses on several strategies:

1. **Hand hygiene**: Appropriate hand washing with soap and warm water is vital to remove spores, as alcohol-based sanitizers are ineffective against C. difficile spores

2. **Isolation**: Isolation of patients with acute diarrhea can prevent the spread of spores within healthcare facilities

3. **Personal protective equipment**: Wearing gloves and gowns when interacting with C. difficile patients

4. **Environmental cleaning**: Daily sporicidal disinfection in patient rooms, using agents that are effective against spores, such as:
   - Glutaraldehyde-containing products
   - Oxygen-releasing agents like peracetic acid
   - Chlorine-releasing products like sodium hypochlorite (though a 2023 British study questioned their effectiveness)

5. **Antibiotic stewardship**: Reducing the length and breadth of antibiotic therapy decreases CDI rates in hospitals

6. **Patient accommodation**: The patient should be accommodated in a single room with its own wet cell, and this isolation should be maintained until at least 48 hours after the end of diarrheal symptoms

7. **Vaccination**: Vaccines are in development, including an mRNA vaccine delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that targets multiple components of C. difficile

## Strains and hypervirulence

Several strains of C. difficile have been identified, with some showing increased virulence:

### BI/NAP1/027 strain

In 2005, molecular analysis led to the identification of a highly virulent strain characterized as:
- Group BI by restriction endonuclease analysis
- North American pulse-field-type NAP1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
- Ribotype 027

This strain, referred to as C. difficile BI/NAP1/027, has caused geographically dispersed outbreaks since 2003 in North America, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and other countries. Its characteristics include:

- A deletion in the tcdC gene (negative regulator), making it unable to control toxin production
- Production of 16 times more toxin A and 23 times more toxin B than typical strains
- Production of binary toxin as a third toxin
- Resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics

### Other emerging strains

As of 2016, the NAP1 strain has been replaced by novel strains in some areas of British Columbia. These include NAP2 and NAP4, and some strains without NAP designation.

Two strains, ribotypes RT078 and RT027, can live on low concentrations of the sugar trehalose. Both strains became more common after trehalose was introduced as a food additive in the early 2000s, thus increasing dietary trehalose intake and potentially contributing to their spread.

## Major outbreaks

Several major outbreaks of C. difficile infection have occurred worldwide:

- **June 2003**: Two outbreaks of a highly virulent strain reported in Montreal (Quebec) and Calgary (Alberta), with between 36 and 89 deaths out of about 1,400 cases in 2003 and early 2004
- **2003-2005**: Similar epidemic at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England
- **October 2006**: At least 49 deaths at Leicester Hospital, UK
- **October-November 2006**: 21 deaths in Quebec attributed to C. difficile
- **2006**: C. difficile mentioned on 6,480 death certificates in the United Kingdom
- **February 2007**: New epidemic at Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga, Ontario
- **February-June 2007**: Three deaths at Loughlinstown Hospital in Dublin, Ireland
- **June 2007-August 2008**: C. difficile implicated in 31 deaths
- **November 2007**: 10 deaths out of 115 infected patients in southern Finland
- **November 2009**: Four deaths at "Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital" in Ireland
- **February 2009-February 2010**: 29 deaths at Copenhagen Hospital
- **2012-2013**: Ten deaths at a hospital in southern Sweden (Ystad)
