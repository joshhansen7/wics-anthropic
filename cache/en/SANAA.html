# SANAA

SANAA (Sejima and Nishizawa and Associates) is a Japanese architectural firm based in Tokyo's [Shinagawa](/article/en/Shinagawa) district. It was founded in 1995 by architects [Kazuyo Sejima](/article/en/Kazuyo_Sejima) (born 1956) and [Ryue Nishizawa](/article/en/Ryue_Nishizawa) (born 1966). The firm has gained international recognition for its distinctive minimalist style and has been awarded numerous prestigious honors, including the [Pritzker Architecture Prize](/article/en/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize) in 2010, widely considered architecture's highest honor. In 2013, [Junko Tanase](/article/en/Junko_Tanase), [Yumiko Yamada](/article/en/Yumiko_Yamada), and [Rikiya Yamamoto](/article/en/Rikiya_Yamamoto) joined as partners.

## History

In 1995, Kazuyo Sejima founded SANAA with Ryue Nishizawa. Prior to this collaboration, Sejima had run her own firm, Kazuyo Sejima & Partners, where Nishizawa had been employed. By 2000, although the firm had completed relatively few buildings, their work had already attracted significant attention in the architectural world.

Their international breakthrough came with several high-profile projects, including the [New Museum of Contemporary Art](/article/en/New_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art) in New York (completed in 2007) and the [21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art](/article/en/21st_Century_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art) in Kanazawa, Japan (completed in 2004). In Germany, the firm became known in 2006 through the Zollverein Cube in Essen, also referred to as the Sanaa Cube or Sanaa Building.

Around 2000, they began a collaboration with South Tyrolean photographer [Walter Niedermayr](/article/en/Walter_Niedermayr), which developed into an exhibition shown in several cities.

## Architectural Style

SANAA is known for its minimalist approach, primarily using exposed concrete, steel, aluminum, and glass. The materials mostly remain untreated, with paint used exclusively in white. Sejima has described their architectural style: "We focus on the essence, which is the most important thing for us, and the essence of a space is white. It couldn't be more reduced; otherwise, our architecture would probably be transparent and invisible."

The Pritzker Prize citation highlighted their unique approach: "Like few other architects, Sejima and Nishizawa explore the phenomena of spatial flow, light, transparency, and materiality to create a subtle synthesis that is entirely their own. [...] Their buildings stand in contrast to the bombastic and rhetorical, with true quality hidden deeper."

According to critic [Niklas Maak](/article/en/Niklas_Maak), SANAA "stands for experimental architecture, for 'thought buildings' in the most literal sense: architectures that show how private life and public space could look beyond what is considered given and unchangeable."

Their work is characterized by lightness, transparency, and a seamless integration with surrounding environments. The firm's buildings often feature clean lines, open spaces, and innovative use of materials that create an impression of weightlessness.
