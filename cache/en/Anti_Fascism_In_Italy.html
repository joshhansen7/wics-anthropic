# Anti-fascism

Anti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups, and individuals. It emerged in the early 1920s as a response to the rise of fascism in Italy and subsequently spread to other countries as fascist movements gained prominence across Europe. Anti-fascism has encompassed a wide spectrum of political positions, including anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism, and syndicalism, as well as centrist, conservative, liberal, and nationalist viewpoints.

## Definition and Scope

According to a definition by the Institute for German Language from 1989, anti-fascism summarizes "in general all forces and movements directed against fascism as well as against neo-fascist and neo-Nazi tendencies." Historian Enzo Traverso describes anti-fascism as encompassing different currents that all claim to be inspired by the Enlightenment and pacifism, defending "the principles of equality, democracy, freedom, and citizenship."

The term "anti-fascist" appeared in France as early as 1922. From its inception, anti-fascism has been characterized by its diversity and plurality. Historians Hugo Garcia, Mercedes Yusta, Xavier Tabet, and Cristina Climaco emphasize that anti-fascism was a "transnational movement" which, not being a "structured movement," manifested in different ways across various countries and political traditions.

According to historian Bruno Groppo, "the fundamental core of anti-fascism was the organized labor movement." However, anti-fascism has historically included a broad coalition of forces united by their opposition to fascism, including liberals, Christians, and various democratic movements.

## Origins

A [fasces](/article/en/Fasces) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, often including an axe with its blade emerging, which symbolized a Roman magistrate's power and jurisdiction. The symbol was adopted by Italian Fascism, which derives its name from the fasces. As Italian Fascism developed and spread in the post-World War I period, it was met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and socialists.

Organizations such as [Arditi del Popolo](/article/en/Arditi_del_Popolo) and the [Italian Anarchist Union](/article/en/Italian_Anarchist_Union) emerged between 1919 and 1921 to combat the nationalist and fascist surge. The Arditi del Popolo, formed in 1921, was the first armed anti-fascist organization with an explicitly anti-fascist self-understanding. Its supporters called themselves "Antifascisti."

As historian Eric Hobsbawm notes, as fascism developed and spread, a "nationalism of the left" emerged in nations threatened by Italian irredentism, particularly in the Balkans and Albania. These early roots of European anti-fascism combined irreconcilable nationalisms and leftist partisans.

Less militant forms of anti-fascism also developed. During the 1930s in Britain, for instance, Christians—especially the Church of England—provided both language of opposition to fascism and inspired anti-fascist action. Philosopher Georges Bataille believed that Friedrich Nietzsche was a forerunner of anti-fascism due to his derision for nationalism and racism.

## History Until 1945

### Italy: First Anti-Fascist Struggles

In 1919, [Benito Mussolini](/article/en/Benito_Mussolini) united various groups in the Kingdom of Italy into the [Fasci di combattimento](/article/en/Fasci_di_combattimento). Their Blackshirts engaged in targeted terror against striking industrial workers, the [Italian Socialist Party](/article/en/Italian_Socialist_Party) (PSI), and any opposition during the [Biennio rosso](/article/en/Biennio_rosso) (1919-1921). This sparked the formation of local and regional anti-fascist groups as well as self-defense groups from 1920 onward, spanning the entire political spectrum from Catholics and liberals to socialists and anarchists.

In 1921, Mussolini transformed his militia movement into the [National Fascist Party](/article/en/National_Fascist_Party). The first armed anti-fascist organization, [Arditi del Popolo](/article/en/Arditi_del_Popolo), was formed the same year. It was open to anarchists, communists, social democrats, Christians, and bourgeois republicans. However, the leadership of the PSI and the [Italian Communist Party](/article/en/Italian_Communist_Party) (PCI) rejected the alliance. It remained limited to a few thousand members and a few cities.

After the [March on Rome](/article/en/March_on_Rome) in 1922, when Mussolini became head of state and established his dictatorship in 1925, an anti-fascist underground press emerged in Italy. The philosopher [Benedetto Croce](/article/en/Benedetto_Croce) wrote an anti-fascist manifesto in March 1925, which was signed by 40 intellectual opponents of Mussolini. In it, he defended the liberal democratic core values of Italy without explaining fascism or calling for a fight against it.

Anti-fascists like [Piero Gobetti](/article/en/Piero_Gobetti) and [Carlo Rosselli](/article/en/Carlo_Rosselli), on the other hand, saw a weakness and complicity of the liberal elite as a major cause of Mussolini's victory. The priest [Luigi Sturzo](/article/en/Luigi_Sturzo) had founded the anti-communist Catholic [Italian People's Party](/article/en/Italian_People's_Party) in 1919. In exile in 1924, he wrote the program "Pensiero antifascista," in which he classified fascism like Stalinism as totalitarianism.

Mussolini had [Giacomo Matteotti](/article/en/Giacomo_Matteotti) and other political opponents murdered in 1924 and banned all opposition parties in 1926. Special courts convicted 5,600 anti-fascists, and about 150,000 were monitored. Around one million Italians left the country, including 15,000 anti-fascists. To bundle their forces, Socialists, Republicans, and the Italian League for Human Rights formed the umbrella organization [Concentrazione Antifascista](/article/en/Concentrazione_Antifascista_Italiana) in exile in France in 1927. The PCI, also in exile, refused to join. Carlo Rosselli founded the resistance group [Giustizia e Libertà](/article/en/Giustizia_e_Libertà) in 1928 after his escape. It could only maintain loose contacts with comrades who remained in Italy. Their resistance cells were small and isolated from one another.

### Slovenians and Croats Under Italianization

The anti-fascist resistance emerged within the Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947), whom the Fascists meant to deprive of their culture, language and ethnicity. The 1920 burning of the [National Hall in Trieste](/article/en/National_Hall_in_Trieste), the Slovene center in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Trieste by the Blackshirts, was praised by Benito Mussolini (yet to become Il Duce) as a "masterpiece of the Triestine fascism" (capolavoro del fascismo triestino). The use of Slovene in public places, including churches, was forbidden, not only in multi-ethnic areas, but also in the areas where the population was exclusively Slovene. Children, if they spoke Slovene, were punished by Italian teachers who were brought by the Fascist State from Southern Italy. Slovene teachers, writers, and clergy were sent to the other side of Italy.

The first anti-fascist organization, called [TIGR](/article/en/TIGR), was formed by Slovenes and Croats in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. Its guerrilla fight continued into the late 1920s and 1930s. By the mid-1930s, 70,000 Slovenes had fled Italy, mostly to Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) and South America.

The Slovene anti-fascist resistance in Yugoslavia during World War II was led by [Liberation Front of the Slovenian People](/article/en/Liberation_Front_of_the_Slovenian_People). The Province of Ljubljana, occupied by Italian Fascists, saw the deportation of 25,000 people, representing 7.5% of the total population, filling up the [Rab concentration camp](/article/en/Rab_concentration_camp) and [Gonars concentration camp](/article/en/Gonars_concentration_camp) as well as other Italian concentration camps.

### Germany: The Weimar Republic and Nazi Regime

In the [First World War](/article/en/World_War_I), the [Social Democratic Party of Germany](/article/en/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany) (SPD) had split into war supporters and war opponents. During the [November Revolution](/article/en/German_Revolution_of_1918–1919) of 1918/19, anti-democratic [Freikorps](/article/en/Freikorps), on behalf of the SPD leadership, crushed the [January Uprising](/article/en/Spartacist_uprising) in Berlin with the associated murder of the [KPD](/article/en/Communist_Party_of_Germany) chairpersons [Rosa Luxemburg](/article/en/Rosa_Luxemburg) and [Karl Liebknecht](/article/en/Karl_Liebknecht), and in the following months also the council republics in some German cities with massacres of thousands of people. This made the division of the German labor movement irreversible.

During the [Kapp Putsch](/article/en/Kapp_Putsch) in 1920, right-wing radical parts of the Reichswehr attempted to overthrow the young [Weimar Republic](/article/en/Weimar_Republic) for the first time. A general strike, which the SPD and trade union leaderships had also called for contrary to their usual line, foiled the putsch. The [Marine Brigade Ehrhardt](/article/en/Marine_Brigade_Ehrhardt), which had participated in it, transformed after its ban into the illegal [Organization Consul](/article/en/Organisation_Consul) and committed [Feme murders](/article/en/Feme_murder) against political opponents, which were often covered up by a nationalist civil service and judiciary.

The [NSDAP](/article/en/Nazi_Party), founded in 1920 in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, represented an ideological mixture of antisemitism, anti-Marxism, racism, militarism, nationalism, and cult of masculinity. Its strategy of using parliamentary forms for a later "seizure of power" and the methods of its [Sturmabteilung](/article/en/Sturmabteilung) (SA) in street terror against left-wing opponents were largely based on the theory and practice of Italian fascists.

The KPD did not understand fascism as an independent phenomenon compared to bourgeois democracy, but merely as a stage of decay and final stage of capitalism, whose fall was imminent. Therefore, it equated anti-fascism directly with anti-capitalism and tried to mobilize workers for a social revolution.

Since the [Hitler Putsch](/article/en/Beer_Hall_Putsch), the SPD leadership also saw [National Socialism](/article/en/Nazism) as a variant of fascism. [Paul Kampffmeyer](/article/en/Paul_Kampffmeyer) warned that the NSDAP wanted to replace democracy with a dictatorship and was being used by certain capital groups against the workers.

In 1924, the government parties of the [Weimar Coalition](/article/en/Weimar_Coalition) founded the [Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold](/article/en/Reichsbanner_Schwarz-Rot-Gold) as a protection force against anti-republican forces from the right and left. It quickly grew to become the largest defense association of the republic (one million members, 90% of them SPD supporters), but remained defensive, unarmed, and relied on cooperation with the police.

In the year of the [Great Depression](/article/en/Great_Depression), 1929, the KPD adopted the social fascism thesis from the [Comintern](/article/en/Comintern). This found approval among many KPD voters because the behavior of SPD governments confirmed it: For example, Prussia's Police President Karl Zörgiebel (SPD) banned the traditional May Day demonstration in 1929, had the police shoot at participants (Bloody May, 33 dead), arrested 1,200, and then banned the [Red Front Fighters' League](/article/en/Red_Front_Fighters'_League) (RFB). Since November 1929, the KPD newspaper [Die Rote Fahne](/article/en/Die_Rote_Fahne) called for counter-violence against the street terror of the SA with the slogan "Beat the fascists wherever you meet them." In December, the KPD founded the Antifascist Young Guard, which continued the actions of the banned RFB.

In 1930, the NSDAP grew abruptly to become the second strongest party after the SPD. Only then did the KPD define the NSDAP as its main opponent for the first time. Some KPD representatives admitted having underestimated the danger of National Socialism.

In 1931, KPD leader [Heinz Neumann](/article/en/Heinz_Neumann) appeared at NSDAP meetings with [Joseph Goebbels](/article/en/Joseph_Goebbels) among others and declared that the communists did not want a "fraternal struggle" with the National Socialists. In addition, the KPD supported a referendum initiated by the NSDAP, DNVP, and Stahlhelm against the SPD state government in Prussia.

In order to bundle the fight against the "National Front," which the NSDAP, DNVP, and Stahlhelm had joined in the fall of 1931, the [Iron Front](/article/en/Iron_Front) was founded in December 1931 on the initiative of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. The leadership of the SPD was initially skeptical but followed the pressure of the party members and took over the leadership of this anti-fascist cartel, which also involved the trade unions and workers' sports clubs. The Iron Front tried to counter the emotional propaganda of the National Socialists with its own symbolism: They formed so-called Hammerschaften as a counterweight to the SA, greeted each other with "Frei Heil!" and developed their own symbol, the [Three Arrows](/article/en/Three_Arrows). The Three Arrows logo became a symbol of anti-fascism.

In 1932, KPD and SPD supporters often formed joint house protection staffs against National Socialist attacks on working-class neighborhoods and meetings. On May 25, 1932, Roland Freisler used a procedural debate in the Prussian Landtag for the NSDAP faction to submit motions for the appointment of investigation committees. After a brawl between National Socialists and Communists, in which several communist and social democratic deputies were partly seriously injured, the session was aborted. This was the trigger for the founding of the [Antifaschistische Aktion](/article/en/Antifaschistische_Aktion) by the KPD in June 1932. This anti-fascist united front proclaimed by the KPD was rejected by the SPD and remained largely inconsequential in the Reichstag election of July 1932.

Only the small parties SAPD, Communist Party-Opposition (KPO), Leninbund, Left Opposition of the KPD, Group Funke, and others strove for an effective anti-fascist united front of all leftists to protect the Weimar Republic. In doing so, they followed the precise, fundamentally consistent fascism analyses of [August Thalheimer](/article/en/August_Thalheimer) and [Leon Trotsky](/article/en/Leon_Trotsky): Once in power, the NSDAP would smash and destroy all organizations of the labor movement and set it back by 100 years.

According to counts at the time, 143 National Socialists and 171 Communists died in street fights from 1930 to 1932.

Large parts of the bourgeoisie supported the transfer of power to Adolf Hitler in January 1933 and most of the steps of the Nazi regime to establish the dictatorship. The Nazi regime feared the KPD as its most determined opponent and therefore banned it first, brought about half of its 360,000 members to concentration camps, and murdered about 25,000 of them. As a result, only isolated small groups practiced anti-fascist resistance in the German Reich.

Many opponents of Hitler and the Nazi regime at the time, who did not belong to any left-wing party and did not call themselves "anti-fascists," are today counted as part of the anti-fascist resistance: for example, the [Edelweißpiraten](/article/en/Edelweißpiraten), helpers for persecuted Jews, partisan groups in areas occupied by the Nazi regime, the participants of the [February Strike](/article/en/February_Strike) 1941 in the Netherlands, the Jewish resistance, such as the [Jewish Combat Organization](/article/en/Jewish_Combat_Organization) during the [Warsaw Ghetto Uprising](/article/en/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising), and insurgents in the Nazi extermination camps.

Some prominent artists and writers had placed their work in the context of international anti-fascism and antimilitarism since the 1920s. They were among those persecuted by the Nazi regime from 1933. Those who remained in Germany or in areas of Europe occupied by it often chose "inner emigration" to survive. In contrast, many artists who fled abroad advocated for a combative art driven by the "principle of anti-fascist solidarity." Well-known works by German anti-fascists were, for example, Lion Feuchtwanger's "The Oppermanns" (1933) and "Exile" (1940), Bertolt Brecht's "Fear and Misery of the Third Reich" (1937 ff.), "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui" (1941), and the novels "The Seventh Cross" (1942) and "Transit" (1944) by Anna Seghers.

### The Communist International and Anti-Fascism

The [Communist International](/article/en/Communist_International) (Comintern), founded in 1919, was supposed to unite all communist parties that had emerged since the October Revolution ideologically and practically toward the goal of proletarian world revolution. From 1922 onward, it applied the term fascism to all ultranationalist or corporatist-authoritarian regimes and movements in Europe, including National Socialism.

Because Mussolini's seizure of power gave other fascist movements significant momentum, the fourth world congress of the Comintern in 1922 addressed the topic of fascism for the first time. It was viewed as an international phenomenon with country-specific manifestations and, analogous to imperialism, was classified in a "period of decline" of capitalism, in which the bourgeoisie tried to stabilize its power at the expense of the labor movement.

In 1923, the Comintern founded an "Anti-Fascist World League," which, however, only existed until March 1924. From 1924, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union dominated the Comintern. Already then, Josef Stalin described social democracy as a "wing of fascism" and as a "twin brother" of National Socialism. The Comintern now promoted the transformation of its member parties into centrally directed organizations that disciplined, disempowered, or expelled internal critics (Stalinization).

In 1929, Stalin gained sole rule in the Soviet Union. His foreign policy followed no ideological principle but sought advantages through changing alliance treaties and played the interests of other states against each other. Now the Comintern propagated the social fascism thesis, according to which social democracy was to be fought as the main enemy. This was justified by the Great Depression and alleged intentions of capitalist states to invade the Soviet Union. Therefore, their proletariat had to be won over to the respective communist parties. All other parties, the free trade unions, the bourgeois state, and parliamentarism were identified with fascism. The previously sought united front against fascist forces was excluded. With this, the Comintern practically abandoned anti-fascism.

After the transfer of power to Adolf Hitler (January 30, 1933), an international congress with around 3,500 anti-fascists was held in Paris from June 4 to 6, which united with the Amsterdam Peace Congress (August 1932) by Henri Barbusse and Romain Rolland to form the World Committee against War and Fascism (WCCF). The initiator of the merger was the German Comintern representative Willi Münzenberg.

Only under strong pressure from Western European communists did the Comintern abandon the social fascism thesis in 1934 and allow its members to form alliances with all anti-fascist parties and organizations. This [Popular Front](/article/en/Popular_Front_(politics)) policy favored a belated upswing of anti-fascism in Europe, the USA, and Latin America. In 1935, at the seventh world congress, the Comintern under Georgi Dimitrov defined fascism in power as "the open, terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, most imperialistic elements of finance capital." This formula referred primarily to the Nazi regime, traced its ideology back to certain socioeconomic interests and their bearers, and distinguished it from its mass base.

Since the Hitler-Stalin Pact of August 1939, the Comintern, on Stalin's orders, completely abandoned anti-fascism and ended the joint Popular Front policy against the Nazi regime. It declared the capitalist states (especially Great Britain and the USA) and again social democracy to be the main enemy and forbade anti-fascists military activities and political mobilization for a war against the Nazi regime. Many communists could no longer support this radical change of course. Only after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 did anti-fascism become the main demand of the Comintern, now as participation in the Soviet war of liberation alongside the Western democracies. In 1943, Stalin had the Comintern dissolved to strengthen the Anti-Hitler Coalition in foreign policy.

### Spain: The Civil War Against Nationalism

The historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote: "The Spanish civil war was both at the centre and on the margin of the era of anti-fascism. It was central, since it was immediately seen as a European war between fascism and anti-fascism, almost as the first battle in the coming world war, some of the characteristic aspects of which – for example, air raids against civilian populations – it anticipated."

The [Second Spanish Republic](/article/en/Second_Spanish_Republic), founded in 1931, was fought from the beginning by the disempowered forces of the right. The unsuccessful coup attempt by some anti-republican military officers in August 1932 was followed by a right-wing shift of the government in 1934. At that time, the salute with the raised clenched fist became a sign of anti-fascist protest. In the following parliamentary elections in July 1936, a Popular Front of liberals, socialists, and communists won. [Francisco Franco](/article/en/Francisco_Franco) then began another military coup, for which he relied on the fascist [Falange](/article/en/Falange_Española) and received massive military and financial aid from Italy and Germany.

During Franco's advance on the capital Madrid, the socialist trade union [Unión General de Trabajadores](/article/en/Unión_General_de_Trabajadores) (UGT) and the anarchist [Confederación Nacional del Trabajo](/article/en/Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo) (CNT) agreed on a joint armed resistance to save the republic and at the same time initiate a social revolution. Volunteers from abroad formed [International Brigades](/article/en/International_Brigades) to support the Republicans, who won their last major victory in the Battle of Guadalajara in March 1937, reinforced by international militiamen such as the Dąbrowski Battalion and the Garibaldi Battalion. The call [No pasaran!](/article/en/¡No_pasarán!) ("They shall not pass!") became the slogan of the anti-fascists.

As a result of the Comintern's shift to the Popular Front policy, the previously insignificant [Partido Comunista de España](/article/en/Communist_Party_of_Spain) (PCE) formed a coalition with the Socialists and Liberals in 1936, but rejected their direct steps to expropriate large landowners and large companies as premature, thus separating armed anti-fascism from social revolution. The smaller Trotskyist [Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista](/article/en/POUM) (POUM), on the other hand, supported the CNT.

During the [Great Terror](/article/en/Great_Purge) in the Soviet Union, the Soviet military intelligence service GRU and agents of the NKVD also carried out attacks on anti-Stalinist leftists in Spain or abducted them to secret prisons. In May 1937, the PCE-affiliated Catalan police confiscated Barcelona's telephone exchange, triggering days of fighting with CNT and POUM supporters. Although the conflict was settled, the anti-fascist unity of the previous months was broken by it. This contributed significantly to Franco's victory (February 1939).

Up to 3,500 of the approximately 5,000 German brigade members were KPD members. After Franco's victory, most of the brigade members did not return to their countries of origin, where they would have been persecuted, but moved to France. There they were interned in camps by the Vichy regime from 1940 and handed over to the Gestapo. Many who managed to escape joined the French Resistance.

### France: Against Action Française and Vichy

In France, the Catholic-monarchist [Action française](/article/en/Action_française) had existed since 1898 with characteristics of fascism, supplemented after the First World War by the party Faisceau, which was modeled on Italian fascists, the rural Comités de défense paysanne, the war veterans' association Croix de Feu, the youth association Jeunesses patriotes, and the National Union of War Participants. In the 1920s, they formed an action alliance called Front National.

During the riots of February 6, 1934, they marched together to the seat of the National Assembly in Paris to overthrow the new center-left government of Édouard Daladier. In a bloody street battle with the police, up to 25 marchers were killed and over 2,000 injured. Daladier resigned as a result. Against the following center-right coalition, which integrated the fascists, all left-wing and bourgeois parties and trade unions agreed on a general strike, which took place on February 12. This led to the Popular Front alliance between the SFIO (Socialists), PCF, a left-liberal party, and the anarchists. This won the parliamentary elections in May 1936, and the Socialist Léon Blum became Prime Minister.

After Germany defeated France in 1940 in the Western Campaign, French anti-fascists concentrated on fighting against the [Vichy regime](/article/en/Vichy_France), which was dependent on the National Socialists, and the German occupation. Patriotic motives also played a strong role in this, as France had previously had a democratic tradition and non-fascist pre-war governments.

The [French Resistance](/article/en/French_Resistance) (French: La Résistance française) fought against the Nazi German occupation and against the collaborationist Vichy régime. Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the maquis in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers and magazines such as Arbeiter und Soldat (Worker and Soldier) during World War Two, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks.

### United Kingdom: Against Mosley's BUF

In Great Britain, the [Imperial Fascist League](/article/en/Imperial_Fascist_League) and the British Fascisti were formed in 1920. However, they remained small and insignificant. In 1931, [Oswald Mosley](/article/en/Oswald_Mosley) founded the fascist New Party, which was exposed to strong anti-fascist resistance from the beginning. Many supporters of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress also participated in this, although their leaderships rejected anti-fascist violence.

In 1933, Mosley founded the [British Union of Fascists](/article/en/British_Union_of_Fascists) (BUF). Its first meeting on April 30, 1933, was successfully disrupted by thousands of British Jews from London's West End. For self-defense, they formed the Zionist League of Jewish Youth and the Jewish United Defense Association. The Ex-Servicemen's Movement against Fascism (EMAF), formed in 1936 by Jewish veterans, on the other hand, aimed to attack British fascism in its core areas.

In October 1936, the BUF wanted to march through the Jewish district of London's East End. The Jewish People's Council Against Fascism and Anti-Semitism (JPC), the EMAF, and other Jewish organizations started a petition against it, which received 77,000 signatures in two days. After the government rejected a ban on the BUF march, the initiators mobilized for a blockade against it. On October 4, 1936, around 100,000 anti-fascists participated in it and forced the police to dissolve the march of about 6,000 BUF supporters with coordinated resistance in the [Battle of Cable Street](/article/en/Battle_of_Cable_Street).

The rise of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s was challenged by the Communist Party of Great Britain, socialists in the Labour Party and Independent Labour Party, anarchists, Irish Catholic dockmen and working class Jews in London's East End. Initially, the national Communist Party leadership wanted a mass demonstration at Hyde Park in solidarity with Republican Spain, instead of a mobilization against the BUF, but local party activists argued against this. Activists rallied support with the slogan They shall not pass, adopted from Republican Spain.

There were debates within the anti-fascist movement over tactics. While many East End ex-servicemen participated in violence against fascists, Communist Party leader Phil Piratin denounced these tactics and instead called for large demonstrations. In addition to the militant anti-fascist movement, there was a smaller current of liberal anti-fascism in Britain; Sir Ernest Barker, for example, was a notable English liberal anti-fascist in the 1930s.

### United States, World War II

Anti-fascist Italian expatriates in the United States founded the [Mazzini Society](/article/en/Mazzini_Society) in Northampton, Massachusetts in September 1939 to work toward ending Fascist rule in Italy. As political refugees from Mussolini's regime, they disagreed among themselves whether to ally with Communists and anarchists or to exclude them. The Mazzini Society joined with other anti-Fascist Italian expatriates in the Americas at a conference in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1942. They unsuccessfully promoted one of their members, Carlo Sforza, to become the post-Fascist leader of a republican Italy. The Mazzini Society dispersed after the overthrow of Mussolini as most of its members returned to Italy.

During the [Second Red Scare](/article/en/Red_Scare#Second_Red_Scare_(1947–1957)) which occurred in the United States in the years that immediately followed the end of World War II, the term "premature anti-fascist" came into currency and it was used to describe Americans who had strongly agitated or worked against fascism, such as Americans who had fought for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, before fascism was seen as a proximate and existential threat to the United States. The implication was that such persons were either Communists or Communist sympathizers whose loyalty to the United States was suspect. However, the historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr have written that no documentary evidence has been found of the US government referring to American members of the International Brigades as "premature antifascists": the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Strategic Services, and United States Army records used terms such as "Communist", "Red", "subversive", and "radical" instead.

### Burma, World War II

The [Anti-Fascist Organisation](/article/en/Anti-Fascist_Organisation) (AFO) was a resistance movement which advocated the independence of Burma and fought against the Japanese occupation of Burma during World War II. It was the forerunner of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The AFO was formed during a meeting which was held in Pegu in August 1944, the meeting was held by the leaders of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), the Burma National Army (BNA) led by General Aung San, and the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), later renamed the Burma Socialist Party.

### Poland, World War II

The [Anti-Fascist Bloc](/article/en/Anti-Fascist_Bloc) was an organization of Polish Jews formed in the March 1942 in the Warsaw Ghetto. It was created after an alliance between leftist-Zionist, communist and socialist Jewish parties was agreed upon. The initiators of the bloc were Mordechai Anielewicz, Józef Lewartowski (Aron Finkelstein) from the Polish Workers' Party, Josef Kaplan from Hashomer Hatzair, Szachno Sagan from Poale Zion-Left, Jozef Sak as a representative of socialist-Zionists and Izaak Cukierman with his wife Cywia Lubetkin from Dror. The Jewish Bund did not join the bloc though they were represented at its first conference by Abraham Blum and Maurycy Orzech.

## Anti-fascism After World War II

### Antifascist Action Committees in Germany

The immediate post-war period in Germany was characterized by an anti-fascist basic consensus, in which the political goals of the Allies strikingly coincided with those of surviving anti-fascists from the concentration camps, exile groups, and representatives of the labor movement in re-admitted or newly admitted parties without agreements. The Buchenwald Manifesto formulated this consensus in April 1945 as an "oath."

Equally widespread was the slogan "Never again fascism! Never again war!", which linked anti-fascism with antimilitarism.

Denazification was considered a priority task. For this purpose, Antifascist Action Committees, abbreviated as Antifa at the time, were spontaneously formed in many German cities. They wanted to:

- dissolve and ban all organizational, institutional, and cultural remnants of the Nazi regime, including the entire Wehrmacht,
- severely punish the main perpetrators in politics, military, administration, and economy,
- remove National Socialists and their collaborators from all public offices and replace them with reliable anti-fascists,
- ban any fascist propaganda,
- educate about the causes, crimes, and goals of fascism.

According to Western research, there were at least 137, according to GDR research at least 500 local and regional Antifa groups in the four occupation zones. They emerged independently of the traditional parties and trade unions, partly already in the final phase of the Nazi regime or shortly thereafter, as provisional administrative bodies and carriers of a new order in Germany. Their supporters were mostly workers, but also bourgeois and left-wing Christians.

In the summer of 1945, the military administrations re-admitted the traditional parties and trade union organizations. First the American, then the British administration banned the Antifa groups again. Due to the high proportion of socialist and communist officers from the Resistance, the French administration followed them only later. The Soviet authorities demanded the dissolution of the Antifa initiatives but rarely with repressive measures, rather through their integration and cooperation in the municipal administrations, the city and community committees, and "block committees" of the "anti-fascist-democratic parties."

By joint Allied order, "Committees for the Victims of Fascism" (OdF) were attached to many city administrations from the summer of 1945, which were both authorities and political representative bodies. They provided social welfare, educational work about the Nazi regime, hunted for Nazi criminals, and organized commemorative events. On the initiative of political persecutees and the Berlin "Main Committee of the Victims of Fascism," the "Day of the Victims of Fascism" was introduced on September 9, 1945, which was supported in Berlin by all newly admitted parties, the Jewish community, the churches, and trade unions. Hundreds of thousands participated in this Germany-wide day of remembrance. In 1947, the all-German non-partisan Association of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime – Federation of Antifascists and Antifascists (VVN) was founded.

### Anti-fascism in the German Democratic Republic

In the [German Democratic Republic](/article/en/German_Democratic_Republic) (GDR), anti-fascism was a state doctrine. Since, unlike in the Federal Republic, the state could not sufficiently justify its existence through elections or economic success, and Marxism-Leninism had little persuasive power among the population, anti-fascism became the central means of political legitimation of the GDR. This was based on the Marxist understanding of the term, according to which fascism is an instrument of the capitalist class. The communist resistance against National Socialism thus became the founding myth of the GDR.

Its anti-fascist founding myth allowed the GDR to denounce the Federal Republic as a state of the same forces that had brought fascism to power in Germany: on the one hand, because former National Socialists had indeed risen to high positions in West Germany, and on the other hand, because capitalism had not been smashed there and therefore allegedly a new fascism was possible at any time. This understanding of anti-fascism shaped the official language use. The political system of the GDR was described as an "anti-fascist structure," the uprising of June 17, 1953, went into the party-official historiography as a "fascist coup attempt," and the Berlin Wall was described as an "anti-fascist protection wall."

The use of the concept of fascism to legitimize one's own system is called an instrumentalization of the history of the "Third Reich" by the historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk. The "transfiguring heroic saga of the antifa myth" (Hans-Ulrich Wehler) faded quickly, which is why the SED regime, in order to maintain power, developed a "socialist social policy" from the 1970s onwards, the "unity of economic and social policy." According to Eckhard Jesse, anti-fascist values remained important because the regime and large parts of the population shared them.

The continuity of NS-Volksgemeinschaft attitudes in the population beyond 1945 and the need for professional experts also led to the institutional continuance of former NSDAP members and followers in the GDR. However, due to state anti-fascism, they were "as a rule denied the return to the area of internal administration, the police and justice apparatus, or as teachers to the school service."

In May 1990, while still in the GDR, the Federation of Antifascists (BdA) was founded. In its program, it condemned the ritualized anti-fascism of the GDR, which had been instrumentalized "as a cover for abuse of power, arbitrariness, and exclusion."

### Adenauer Era in West Germany

During the Cold War, anti-communism established itself as an influential political concept in the Federal Republic of Germany, and anti-fascism in the GDR. Anti-communism was virtually elevated to a state doctrine in the West. This resulted in consequences for dealing with the völkisch and Nazi heritage. Anti-communism formed an intersection of the Nazi regime with Western Allied anti-communist policy. The continuation of anti-communism enabled a continuity that was socially popular and politically desired in the Adenauer era, unlike the traditional antisemitism, which was closely linked to it but compromised by the mass crimes.

Western anti-communism led to the ban of the KPD in the Federal Republic in 1956. Already in 1951, its youth organization, the FDJ, had been banned after the criminal offenses of "high treason," "endangering the state," and "treason" had been revised in 1951 with the First Criminal Law Amendment Act ("Flash Law"). The Federal Republic was now the only European state within the West – apart from the one-party dictatorships in Portugal and Spain – with a ban on the Communist Party and a resulting persecution of communists. In the 1950s and 1960s, about 80 actually or allegedly communist organizations were banned, at least 125,000 proceedings were opened against communists, left-wing socialists, and others suspected of left-wing sympathies, and far more than 7,000 convictions to prison sentences were pronounced. Those affected had often already been persecuted under the Nazi regime as anti-fascists.

This continued even when, in the course of the normalization of relations between the two German states, a re-establishment of a communist party in West Germany became possible with the DKP. Accompanying this, exclusion and repression of leftists, but especially of communists, were continued through a "Radical Decree" (1972), which made occupational bans possible. This was accompanied by the observation of suspects by West German intelligence services and the public ostracism of people with an anti-fascist self-understanding as "communist-influenced" and "GDR-controlled." Nevertheless, the VVN as the only nationwide cross-party anti-fascist organization did not disintegrate and was able to continue its activities.

### Student Movements and the 1970s-1980s

In the Federal Republic, the student movement after the Spiegel affair in 1962, in which it saw freedom of the press threatened, triggered an Extra-Parliamentary Opposition (APO) and increasingly dealt with the unprocessed Nazi past. Among other things, it fought against the re-emergence of many former National Socialists in politics, justice, and administration, the line-drawing debates during the Auschwitz trials, the newly founded NPD, the emergency laws, the Vietnam War of the USA, and the authoritarian constitution of many universities. At the same time, new, anti-authoritarian forms of action emerged, with which the VVN-BdA, the DGB Youth, GEW Youth, Friends of Nature, Jusos, JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke, Socialist German Workers' Youth, and others partially showed solidarity.

In the 1970s, there were demonstrations against the occupational bans (from 1972), against the regime of Augusto Pinochet (after the military coup in Chile in 1973), for the Carnation Revolution in Portugal (1974), for the "30th anniversary of the liberation from Hitler fascism and war" (May 8, 1975), against Bundeswehr contacts with representatives of the Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and the HIAG (for example in the Rudel affair in 1976). Protests against and blockades of NPD events had already reached tens of thousands of participants between 1966 and 1969.

In May 1980, the Association of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime – Federation of Antifascists (VVN-BdA) held the congress "How Fascism Emerges – and Is Prevented" in Mannheim. There, the fascism researcher Reinhard Kühnl explained that anti-fascism, together with the struggle for peace, had the greatest alliance potential. On the occasion of the 1980 federal election, the campaign Stop Strauß! was directed against the candidacy of Franz Josef Strauß for chancellor.

Since Helmut Kohl's chancellorship (from October 1982), right-wing extremists increasingly attacked the West German culture of remembrance of the Nazi era. On the 50th anniversary of the National Socialist "seizure of power" (January 30, 1983), around 100,000 anti-fascists demonstrated for "Never again fascism – Never again war! No new nuclear missiles!" The VVN-BdA participated in the Krefeld Appeal and various actions of the peace movement against the NATO Double-Track Decision.

### Contemporary Antifa Movements

Modern antifa politics can be traced to opposition to the infiltration of Britain's punk scene by white power skinheads in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of neo-Nazism in Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall. In Germany, young leftists, including anarchists and punk fans, renewed the practice of street-level anti-fascism. Columnist Peter Beinart writes that "in the late '80s, left-wing punk fans in the United States began following suit, though they initially called their groups Anti-Racist Action (ARA) on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than they would be with fighting fascism".

The contemporary antifa movement in Germany comprises different anti-fascist groups which usually use the abbreviation antifa and regard the historical Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa) of the early 1930s as an inspiration, drawing on the historic group for its aesthetics and some of its tactics, in addition to the name. Many new antifa groups formed from the late 1980s onward. According to Loren Balhorn, contemporary antifa in Germany "has no practical historical connection to the movement from which it takes its name but is instead a product of West Germany's squatter scene and autonomist movement in the 1980s".

One of the biggest antifascist campaigns in Germany in recent years was the ultimately successful effort to block the annual Nazi-rallies in the east German city of Dresden in Saxony which had grown into "Europe's biggest gathering of Nazis". Unlike the original Antifa which had links to the Communist Party of Germany and which was concerned with industrial working-class politics, the late 1980s and early 1990s, autonomists were independent anti-authoritarian libertarian Marxists and anarcho-communists not associated with any particular party. The publication Antifaschistisches Infoblatt, in operation since 1987, sought to expose radical nationalists publicly.

German government institutions such as the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Federal Agency for Civic Education describe the contemporary antifa movement as part of the extreme left and as partially violent. Antifa groups are monitored by the federal office in the context of its legal mandate to combat extremism. The federal office states that the underlying goal of the antifa movement is "the struggle against the liberal democratic basic order" and capitalism. In the 1980s, the movement was accused by German authorities of engaging in terrorist acts of violence.

In Greece, anti-fascism is a popular part of leftist and anarchist culture, September 2013 anti-fascist hip-hop artist Pavlos 'Killah P' Fyssas was accosted and attacked with bats and knives by a large group of Golden Dawn affiliated people leaving Pavlos to be pronounced dead at the hospital. The attack lead international protests and riots, the retaliatory shooting of three Golden Dawn members outside of their Neo Irakleio as well as condemnations against the party by politicians and other public figures, including Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. This episode led to Golden Dawn to being criminally investigated, with the result in sixty-eight members of Golden Dawn being declared part of a criminal organization whilst fifteen out of the seventeen members accused in Pavlos's murder were convicted, "effectively banning" the party.

Dartmouth College historian Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, credits the ARA as the precursor of modern antifa groups in the United States. In the late 1980s and 1990s, ARA activists toured with popular punk rock and skinhead bands in order to prevent Klansmen, neo-Nazis and other assorted white supremacists from recruiting. Their motto was "We go where they go" by which they meant that they would confront far-right activists in concerts and actively remove their materials from public places. In 2002, the ARA disrupted a speech in Pennsylvania by Matthew F. Hale, the head of the white supremacist group World Church of the Creator, resulting in a fight and twenty-five arrests. In 2007, Rose City Antifa, likely the first group to utilize the name antifa, was formed in Portland, Oregon. Other antifa groups in the United States have other genealogies. In 1987 in Boise, Idaho, the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment (NWCAMH) was created in response to the Aryan Nation's annual meeting near Hayden Lake, Idaho. The NWCAMH brought together over 200 affiliated public and private organizations, and helped people, across six states—Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a group called the Baldies was formed in 1987 with the intent to fight neo-Nazi groups directly. In 2013, the "most radical" chapters of the ARA formed the Torch Antifa Network which has chapters throughout the United States. Other antifa groups are a part of different associations such as NYC Antifa or operate independently.

Modern antifa in the United States is a highly decentralized movement. Antifa political activists are anti-racists who engage in protest tactics, seeking to combat fascists and racists such as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other far-right extremists. This may involve digital activism, harassment, physical violence, and property damage against those whom they identify as belonging to the far-right. According to antifa historian Mark Bray, most antifa activity is nonviolent, involving poster and flyer campaigns, delivering speeches, marching in protest, and community organizing on behalf of anti-racist and anti-white nationalist causes.

## Types of Anti-fascism

Michael Seidman argues that traditionally anti-fascism was seen as the purview of the political left but that in recent years this has been questioned. Seidman identifies two types of anti-fascism, namely revolutionary and counterrevolutionary:

### Revolutionary Anti-fascism

Revolutionary anti-fascism was expressed amongst communists and anarchists, where it identified fascism and capitalism as its enemies and made little distinction between fascism and other forms of right-wing authoritarianism. It did not disappear after the Second World War but was used as an official ideology of the Soviet bloc, with the "fascist" West as the new enemy.

### Counterrevolutionary Anti-fascism

Counterrevolutionary anti-fascism, also known as conservative and liberal anti-fascism, refers to the opposition to fascism grounded in the defense of democracy, constitutional order, and traditional institutions. Unlike revolutionary anti-fascism, which aims for social and political transformation, counterrevolutionary anti-fascism is focused on preserving or restoring pre-war political systems, such as constitutional monarchies and republics based on Enlightenment ideals.

This form of anti-fascism is often associated with prominent figures such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, who opposed fascist authoritarianism while also resisting revolutionary movements that sought to radically change society. It was supported by a broad coalition of groups, including capitalists, trade unionists, social democrats, and traditionalists, all of whom united in their opposition to fascism and their support for political stability.

Counterrevolutionary anti-fascism sought to challenge fascist ideologies and movements, aiming to preserve existing democratic structures and stabilize society. It focused on reinforcing confidence in democratic governance and addressing extremist movements, setting itself apart from revolutionary anti-fascism, which frequently aimed at challenging capitalist systems.

In Britain, conservative anti-fascism primarily concentrated on maintaining democratic governance and marginalizing fascist groups through legal and institutional means. Liberal anti-fascism, on the other hand, opposed fascism through media campaigns, petitions, parliamentary debates, and public discourse. Both forms recognized fascism as a threat to state stability, and both approached revolutionary ideologies, including communism, with caution. British counterrevolutionary anti-fascism in the 1930s was shaped by an alliance that transcended traditional political divisions. Churchill's leadership was pivotal in creating an antifascist front that included both conservative and social democratic figures. This coalition rejected the idea that fascism was the only way to prevent communism and instead promoted a defense of "ordered freedom," which emphasized representative democracy, religious tolerance, and private property. Through organizations like the Anti-Nazi Council, the counterrevolutionary antifascist movement rallied elites across the political spectrum, including trade unionists and churchmen, to oppose fascism and preserve liberal democracy. This broader vision of antifascism, distinct from Marxist and communist approaches, helped shape Britain's resistance to Nazi aggression.

French counterrevolutionary anti-fascism, particularly in the years leading up to and during World War II, was characterized by opposition to both Italian Fascism and German Nazism. Figures such as Benjamin Crémieux, a Jewish intellectual, criticized Mussolini's anti-parliamentarianism and the Fascist regime's approach to democracy, expressing concern about a potential alignment between Italian Fascism and far-right movements in France. Meanwhile, journals like L'Europe Nouvelle and individuals such as Georges Bernanos and Charles de Gaulle opposed the policy of appeasement, emphasizing the potential dangers of Fascism's totalitarianism. They also critiqued the French right's minimization of the threats posed by Hitler and Mussolini and advocated for an anti-fascist stance, which, in some cases, included support for alliances with the Soviet Union despite differing views on Communism. This counterrevolutionary anti-fascism was influenced by concerns over national sovereignty, democracy, and resistance to totalitarian movements.

In the United States, a coalition of liberals and conservatives, particularly under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, opposed fascism through both political and military means, with an emphasis on preserving democratic institutions in the face of growing fascist threats. American counterrevolutionary anti-fascism emerged as a response to the increasing spread of fascism in Europe and the potential for its expansion into the Western Hemisphere. Initially, Roosevelt navigated a delicate balance, adopting limited measures to avoid alienating isolationist sentiment while preparing for the possibility of war. As Germany's expansion progressed, Roosevelt shifted towards providing more active support for Britain and its allies, eventually securing public and political backing for military aid. Despite opposition from isolationists and anti-interventionists, Roosevelt's administration, supported by business and labor leaders, increasingly aligned with anti-fascist forces. This shift in American foreign policy reinforced the country's focus on countering Nazi Germany, reducing the influence of isolationists, and establishing an anti-fascist position. Examples of anti-fascist propaganda in the United States are the films Hitler's Reign of Terror (1934), often credited as being the "first-ever American anti-Nazi film," and Don't Be a Sucker (1943).

## Contemporary Developments

At the beginning of the 21st century, a younger anti-fascism less tied to parties developed. These anti-fascists often reuse the Three Arrows logo, invented in the early 1930s by German anti-Nazis. They emphasize the necessity of preventing racist and homophobic aggression from neofascist groups.

Belgian historian Julien Dohet writes that "today as yesterday, the anti-fascist struggle must therefore be intimately linked to the anti-racist struggle." He considers that "anti-fascism can only be alive and represent an alternative if it is plural, rich in the diversity of its members, its methods, its debates, and the alternatives it carries."

According to Gilles Vergnon, professor of contemporary history at the Institut d'études politiques de Lyon and author of "Anti-fascism in France," "the anti-fascist movement is no longer organized at the national level as it was in the 1990s," and furthermore, "it is a movement that postulates radical anti-fascism, meaning it is not a question of having broad alliances against the National Front: they ally neither with the moderate right nor with the government left."

Currently, the heritage of the anti-fascist tradition is claimed by movements often situated on the far left: REFLEXes, SCALP-No Pasaran, Francs-tireurs partisans, Belgian Antifascist Coordination, etc.

This specific anti-fascism, which often claims to be inspired by the German anti-fascist experience of the 1930s, notably by the propagandist Serge Tchakhotine, appeared in the post-war years, then developed from the 1960s and 1970s. It no longer opposes only fascist and Nazi groups but extends its action to all so-called "hard right" policies, whether security-oriented, conservative, or nationalist, even "neo-liberal." It is also characterized by a rejection of all "politicking."

The current anti-fascist movement is also strongly linked to the "leftist skinhead" scene and to the Redskin movement (communist, Trotskyist, libertarian communist, autonomous skinheads...) which is its most politicized fraction, and through organizations like RASH (Red and Anarchist SkinHeads) and SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice), as well as to a part of the anti-globalization and anti-capitalist movement that gave rise to "Antifa(s)" groups. The abbreviation that appeared in the early 1980s designates an individual or movement claiming to be part of the anti-fascism of the radical and autonomous left.

A June 2020 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies of 893 terrorism incidents in the United States since 1994 found one attack staged by an anti-fascist that led to a fatality (the 2019 Tacoma attack, in which the attacker, who identified as an anti-fascist, was killed by police), while attacks by white supremacists or other right-wing extremists resulted in 329 deaths. Since the study was published, one homicide has been connected to anti-fascism. A DHS draft report from August 2020 similarly did not include "antifa" as a considerable threat, while noting white supremacists as the top domestic terror threat.

## Criticism

### Instrumentalization by the Stalinist Movement

Some personalities analyzed the way anti-fascism was instrumentalized by Communist Parties under Stalinist domination. George Orwell, himself an anti-fascist, wrote in "Spilling the Spanish Beans" (New English Weekly, July 29 and September 2, 1937): "It is unfortunate that so few people in England have understood that communism is today a counter-revolutionary force and that communists everywhere are allying with bourgeois reformists, implementing all the resources of their powerful apparatus to crush or discredit parties showing the slightest revolutionary inclination."

In Italy, the debate on anti-fascism has animated the community of historians for thirty years: it had been opened by the historian of fascism Renzo De Felice in his "Intervista sul fascismo," an interview book that had then opened an intense historiographical debate. In particular, he believes that fascism is a dated phenomenon that has disappeared. For him, maintaining an anti-fascist movement makes no sense, and anti-fascism is a myth that functions to legitimize the Italian communist party.

Galli della Loggia thus writes in XXe siècle: "Very early, and increasingly, anti-fascism became a simple tool of the communist party in its struggle against its enemies, periodically accused of working to restore an authoritarian regime." And to add that the Italian communist party deliberately sought to exaggerate the fascist threat to give itself legitimacy: "The communist party thus oriented its political and cultural action [...] by constructing the image of an eternally threatening fascism."

Such a debate was held, later, in France: historian Annie Kriegel raised this question in 1990 in an article, "On Anti-fascism," published in the journal Commentaire. François Furet's work, "The Passing of an Illusion," is the one that most widely spread these ideas, in 1995. Thus, Furet, a former militant of the Stalinist PCF, writes that communist movements nurtured a voluntary and erroneous assimilation between fascism and anti-communism. For him, this deliberately wanted confusion would have blocked any critical analysis of communism, since making this analysis would amount to defending fascism. François Furet applies this anti-fascism particularly to Stalinism.

For Amadeo Bordiga and the Bordiguists (a small Leninist current), anti-fascism is a "bourgeois ideology," aiming to mix the interests of the proletariat with those of the bourgeoisie, to safeguard capitalism in crisis. They reject both the Popular Front and the United Front. For them, fascism is a typical, but not extraordinary, phenomenon of the victorious counter-revolution after the crushing of workers following the First World War and the failure of the revolutionary wave of the 1920s. The counter-revolution is characterized by the rise of fascism, Stalinism, and Nazism in Europe. This phenomenon leads to the second imperialist world war. It is therefore a historical and global phenomenon that must be fought, but not by defending democracy or freedoms with liberal bourgeois. It is a policy of capitalism in its phase of historical crisis.

### Contemporary Criticisms

Some analysts criticize the contemporary anti-fascist movement for its selective battles: for Pierre-André Taguieff, philosopher and political scientist, the indignation of anti-fascists towards certain dictatorships would be motivated more by political motives than by a real interest in the fate of populations under the yoke of dictators. He thus writes that "since the 1970s, the most resolute 'anti-fascists' never mobilize against dictators in power in the world and do not seem to be indignant at the multiple tyrannical regimes that deprive millions of men of freedom." For Taguieff, anti-fascism falls into Manichaeism with its "sacred figures" like Fidel Castro or Mao and its obsessions like the United States or the far right. Thus, according to him, "the anti-fascist posture, by dint of becoming rigid, is confused with the Manichean simplism of the most sectarian and obtuse libertarian mentality."

For historian Frédéric Le Moal, anti-fascism has never been stronger since fascism disappeared. Although the latter is represented only by a few small groups, anti-fascism remains "a powerful instrument of political instrumentalization and a formidable lever of mobilization, even today," because "once the very practical and easy label of fascist is attached to the political opponent, there is no longer any need to argue with him." Historian Emmanuel Debono also notes that in the political-associative field, it has become "common to seek to disqualify an enemy by affiliating him with past and future fascist regimes." While the reference to anti-fascism is attractive because it presents itself as a muscular opposition to the national-populist current, Debono is not certain that it constitutes a relevant analysis and that it can prove to be the most suitable to counter it. According to him, "the application of a historical model, even powerfully evocative, shows more than ever its exhaustion."
