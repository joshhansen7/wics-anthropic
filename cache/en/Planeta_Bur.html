# Planeta Bur

**Planeta Bur** (Russian: Планета бурь, lit. 'Planet of Storms') is a 1962 Soviet science fiction adventure film directed by [Pavel Klushantsev](/article/en/Pavel_Klushantsev) about an expedition to [Venus](/article/en/Venus). The screenplay was written by [Alexander Kazantsev](/article/en/Alexander_Kazantsev) and Pavel Klushantsev, based on Kazantsev's novel of the same name.

In English, the film is often informally referred to as "Planet of Storms," "Planet of Tempests," or "Storm Planet." It was never theatrically released in the United States in its original form before appearing on home video in the 1990s. However, it became known to American audiences through two re-edited versions: [Roger Corman's](/article/en/Roger_Corman) "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" (1965) and "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women" (1968).

The film gained international recognition for its groundbreaking special effects and innovative filming techniques, which were ahead of their time. It had a significant influence on science fiction cinema worldwide and has been acknowledged as an inspiration by directors including [Stanley Kubrick](/article/en/Stanley_Kubrick) and [George Lucas](/article/en/George_Lucas).

## Plot

The film begins with a dedication in the opening credits (from the Russian version):

*"Scientific information about Venus is scarce and contradictory. Only imagination can look into this undiscovered world. It may turn out to be different from what is shown in our film. But we believe in the future feat of Soviet people who will see the planet of storms with their own eyes."*

Three Soviet spaceships—Sirius, Vega, and Capella (called Aldebaran in some versions)—are on their way from Lunar Station 7 for the first human landing on Venus. The expedition includes both Soviet cosmonauts and an American scientist. During the journey, Capella is suddenly struck by a large meteorite and completely destroyed, killing all aboard.

After mourning the loss of their comrades, the crews of the remaining ships, Sirius and Vega, must decide whether to continue the mission. The original plan required three ships, and a replacement spacecraft, Arcturus, will be sent from Earth but won't arrive for two months. The cosmonauts collectively agree that proceeding with the landing and exploration is preferable to waiting.

The Sirius crew consists of three cosmonauts: Ilya Vasilyevich Vershinin, Roman Bobrov, and Alyosha. The Vega crew includes Ivan "Vanya" Shcherba, Masha Ivanova, and the American Allan Kern, along with his humanoid robot John.

To find a suitable landing site for Sirius, Ivan and Allan, along with the partly disassembled robot John, descend toward Venus in Vega's glider, leaving Masha in orbit to maintain communications. The glider finds a suitable area, drops a radio beacon, but is blown off course by strong winds and makes an emergency landing in a swampy region. All contact with them is lost after they land.

Sirius follows the radio beacon and safely lands vertically on its four shock-absorbing wing struts in a different location with volcanic terrain. Since the atmosphere is poisonous, the crew exits the spacecraft in spacesuits. While exploring the foggy surroundings, Alyosha is attacked and dragged off by a large carnivorous plant with octopus-like tentacles. Ilya and Roman quickly rescue him after being alerted by eerie siren-like sounds.

Meanwhile, after completely assembling robot John, Ivan and Allan are attacked in the swamp by several human-sized tyrannosaur-like beasts, which they fend off with handguns. They later come across a large, deep ravine. John uses his strength to pull down a gigantic tree to create a bridge across the gorge, which they cross while listening to recorded music. Allan is weakened by a wound from the attack at the swamp, so John finds a cave for their protection. Both men develop a fever and are soon too weak to stand.

The Sirius crew sets out to search for their colleagues in a hovercraft vehicle, which hovers above the ground but is designed only for short distances. During their journey, they hear what sounds like the distant singing of a woman, and encounter a gigantic, peaceful brontosaurus-like creature, from which they quickly take a blood sample from its tail.

While flying over an ocean near a beach, the Sirius crew is attacked by a large pterodactyl-like flying creature with glowing eyes. Despite using their on-board gun, they are forced to submerge their vehicle to escape. While underwater, they discover what appears to be the ruins of an ancient city and a sculpture of the flying creature's head with rubies for eyes, suggesting it was made by an intelligent species. Alyosha also finds a strange triangular rock, which he takes with him.

After reaching the shore, the Sirius crew re-establishes radio contact with robot John. Learning of Ivan and Allan's fevers, they instruct John to administer life-saving medicine to the men. Ivan and Allan soon recover, but are threatened by an erupting volcano and advancing lava flow. Ivan instructs John to carry them across the steaming mud, but the robot overheats from their added weight. As John attempts to remove them from his shoulders, he injures Allan in the process. The hovercraft arrives just in time to rescue the men, but John, now non-functional from the intense heat, slowly descends into the molten lava with his arm raised upward.

During their return journey to Sirius, they again observe prehistoric creatures, including another brontosaurus-like animal and fin-backed dinosaur-like creatures. 

Back at Sirius, they discover a recorded message from Masha stating that she intends to defy orders from Earth and land on Venus to search for them. This causes great concern since if she lands, returning to Earth would become impossible for everyone. Contact with Masha is unsuccessful.

The situation worsens when an earthquake and flooding from torrential rain threaten the stability of Sirius, forcing an immediate departure. As they prepare for takeoff, Alyosha discovers that his strange triangular rock has crumbled apart to reveal a small sculpture of a beautiful woman's face, proving there is or was intelligent life on Venus. He excitedly calls attention to his discovery as the others hurriedly pull him into Sirius. The spacecraft launches just before the ground begins to break apart.

Rising into space, they reestablish radio contact with Masha, who reveals she ultimately decided to remain in orbit as ordered, though in a modified trajectory. Sirius then proceeds to safely return to Lunar Station 7.

In the final scene of the original film (not present in all versions), after the spacecraft has departed, the reflection of a white-clad female figure appears in a puddle of water on Venus, stretching her hands toward the departing ship.

## Production

### Screenplay
The film was based on Alexander Kazantsev's novel of the same name, also known as "Grandchildren of Mars." While the film generally follows the plot of the novel, there are some differences. In the novel, two Soviet ships named "Knowledge" and "Dream" and one American ship "Prosperity" travel to Venus, whereas in the film all three ships are Soviet but with an international crew. Character names were also changed; for example, Mary from the novel became Masha, and Oleksa became Alyosha.

The novel noted the competition between the USA and USSR in space exploration and included a subplot about a stone calendar identical to one found on Earth, suggesting that visitors from Mars had been to both Earth and Venus in the past. The film only hints at this possibility. In the literary work, the Venusian woman at the end deliberately took items left behind by the Earthlings so that her civilization could be revived, rather than the items being hastily abandoned. "Planeta Bur" became the only screen adaptation of Alexander Kazantsev's work.

### Filming
The film was produced at the [Lennauchfilm](/article/en/Lennauchfilm) studio in 1961 and premiered on April 14, 1962. Pavel Klushantsev, who directed the film, was known for his innovations in special effects.

"Planeta Bur" was created using unique composite filming technologies that were far ahead of foreign counterparts at that time, including groundbreaking underwater filming. The special effects were particularly notable for the era, especially considering the film's modest budget.

Master of sports wrestler and [sambo](/article/en/Sambo_(martial_art)) fighter Boris Prudkovsky played robot John because only a trained athlete could move in the heavy metal "armor" that realistically depicted the robot's construction; the sportsman couldn't move in it for long periods.

During filming, it was discovered that the rocket created for the film resembled one developed by [Sergei Korolev](/article/en/Sergei_Korolev), and its external appearance could not be shown for security reasons. The film was shot in the same pavilion where cooking shows would later be filmed.

The flying hovercraft vehicle was created by ZIL engineers and bears a resemblance to the landspeeder from George Lucas's "Star Wars" (1977). The planetary rover developed for filming reportedly cost 400,000 rubles—at that time, approximately the cost of 60 [Volga](/article/en/GAZ-21) cars.

Special spacesuits were developed for the film, the design of which allegedly influenced the Soviet space program and later appeared in [Ridley Scott's](/article/en/Ridley_Scott) film "Prometheus." The technique of shooting through an aquarium used in the film was later employed by director [James Cameron](/article/en/James_Cameron) when filming "Titanic."

The film was popular in the Soviet Union, running in distribution for about 6 months and regularly drawing lines at cinema box offices.

## Distribution and American Adaptations

Distribution rights to the film were purchased by 28 countries. The film gained particular notoriety through its American adaptations.

In 1965, American film producer [Roger Corman](/article/en/Roger_Corman) gained access to the Soviet film footage and hired film student [Curtis Harrington](/article/en/Curtis_Harrington) to prepare it for an American release. Harrington added several American-made scenes starring [Basil Rathbone](/article/en/Basil_Rathbone) and [Faith Domergue](/article/en/Faith_Domergue), which replaced scenes featuring some of the Russian cast, and dubbed the dialogue into English. The resulting film, re-titled "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet," was distributed directly to television by [American International Pictures](/article/en/American_International_Pictures).

In the cast and credits, the Russian actors' names were replaced with fake non-Russian names; for example, the Russian actor Georgiy Zhzhonov was credited as "Kurt Boden" and Gennadi Vernov as "Robert Chantal." There was no acknowledgment that the film originated in the USSR. The new version also included footage from another Soviet science fiction film, [Mikhail Karyukov's](/article/en/Mikhail_Karyukov) "The Sky Calls" (Nebo Zovyot).

In 1968, film director [Peter Bogdanovich](/article/en/Peter_Bogdanovich) (under the pseudonym "Derek Thomas") was hired by Corman to create a second, different American version, re-titled "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women." This adaptation added new scenes featuring American actress [Mamie Van Doren](/article/en/Mamie_Van_Doren) and several other attractive women playing Venusian natives wearing sea shell brassieres. This second Americanized version is essentially the same story as Corman's first adaptation but told with a parallel viewpoint of telepathic Venusian women whose god (the pterodactyl-like creature) is killed by the Earth men. The film includes an ironic ending in which the Venusian women find a new god to worship: the now eroded and non-functional robot John.

Corman's second version may have had some limited theatrical releases in the American South on the drive-in circuit but primarily became a "TV movie" released through American International Television.

## International Versions

A German version was created at the [VEB DEFA](/article/en/DEFA) Studio for Synchronization, Atelier Weimar. Egon Sartorius wrote the German dialogues, and Hella Graf directed. This version is slightly shortened; for example, Masha is absent from the only depictions of weightlessness, and at the end, the reflection of the alien female figure in the water is missing.

On the German DVD market, the film was released as "Planet der Stürme" with its original DEFA synchronization. In addition, a German version of the US version "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" was released on DVD under the title "Reise zum prähistorischen Planeten."

## Reception and Legacy

In a retrospective on Soviet science fiction film, British director [Alex Cox](/article/en/Alex_Cox) remarked that "in its final minutes, Planet of Storms takes an extraordinary turn. ... I shall not spoil the secret, but it's worth the wait."

The character of the female cosmonaut Masha, portrayed as emotional and arguably mentally unstable, was criticized by the Soviet government and press as misogynistic. [USSR Minister of Culture](/article/en/Ministry_of_Culture_(Soviet_Union)) [Ekaterina Furtseva](/article/en/Ekaterina_Furtseva) reportedly noted that while the film was very interesting, a Soviet female cosmonaut has no right to sob in space or lose self-control in a difficult moment. This criticism allegedly damaged Klushantsev's career.

For the International Film Lexicon, "Planeta Bur" was "a moderately entertaining, unpretentious science fiction film that tells its story with incredible naivety."

The Monthly Film Bulletin concluded that "this Russian space opera" was "more reasonable" compared to "an average American production" and reflected "more genuine" science fiction "than is normally the case."

The film had a significant influence on domestic and world science fiction cinema in the following decades and is recognized as an important milestone in world science fiction cinematography. Several elements from the film allegedly influenced later works:

- The design of the flying hovercraft vehicle bears resemblance to the landspeeder in "Star Wars" (1977)
- The robot John's demise in lava with an outstretched arm predates similar scenes in films like "Terminator 2"
- The film's spacesuits allegedly influenced both Soviet space technology and appeared in later science fiction films
- The underwater filming techniques were innovative for their time

Directors [Steven Spielberg](/article/en/Steven_Spielberg) and George Lucas have reportedly acknowledged that watching "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" in childhood influenced their work.

Excerpts from "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women," including footage from the original "Planeta Bur," were used in creating the music video "Everything That Is Difficult Will Come to an End" by the British group [Flotation Toy Warning](/article/en/Flotation_Toy_Warning) in 2017.

In the USA, a videocassette was temporarily offered that contained both "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" and the also heavily edited US version of the DEFA film "Der schweigende Stern" (released as "First Spaceship on Venus").

## Trivia
- The Sirius glider bears a strong resemblance to the Supercar from the British television series [Supercar](/article/en/Supercar_(TV_series)) by [Gerry Anderson](/article/en/Gerry_Anderson), which aired in Great Britain and the USA from 1961 to 1962.
- The predatory lizards in the swamp resemble man-sized versions of the monster [Godzilla](/article/en/Godzilla), created in 1954.
- Shcherba shoots at the predatory creatures with a [Makarov pistol](/article/en/Makarov_pistol), while Kern fights with a [Borchardt C93](/article/en/Borchardt_C93) pistol, recognizable by the characteristic knee-joint lock. Although the Borchardt C93 is a powerful weapon, it was already outdated by decades in 1961 (manufactured 1894-1898) and doesn't fit the futuristic setting.
- The cosmonauts wear the standard wristband compass (Adrian type) of the Soviet armed forces on their wrists.
