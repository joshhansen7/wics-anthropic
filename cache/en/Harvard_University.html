# Harvard University

Harvard University is a private [Ivy League](/article/en/Ivy_League) research university in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](/article/en/Cambridge,_Massachusetts), [United States](/article/en/United_States). Founded on October 28, 1636, and named for its first benefactor, the [Puritan](/article/en/Puritan) clergyman [John Harvard](/article/en/John_Harvard), it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and one of the most prestigious universities in the world.

Harvard was established by the [Massachusetts General Court](/article/en/Massachusetts_General_Court), the governing legislature of the colonial-era [Massachusetts Bay Colony](/article/en/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony). Its initial purpose was to train Puritan ministers, as stated in a 1643 publication: "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust." Although never formally affiliated with any religious denomination, Harvard primarily educated [Congregational](/article/en/Congregational_church) clergy in its early years.

Over time, Harvard's curriculum and student body gradually secularized. By the 19th century, it had emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among Boston's elite. Following the [American Civil War](/article/en/American_Civil_War), under Harvard president [Charles William Eliot's](/article/en/Charles_William_Eliot) long tenure (1869-1909), the university developed multiple professional schools and transformed into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the [Association of American Universities](/article/en/Association_of_American_Universities).

The university consists of ten academic faculties plus the [Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study](/article/en/Radcliffe_Institute_for_Advanced_Study). The [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](/article/en/Harvard_Faculty_of_Arts_and_Sciences) offers study in undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, while other faculties offer primarily graduate and professional degrees.

Harvard has three main campuses: the 209-acre (85 ha) main campus in Cambridge centered on [Harvard Yard](/article/en/Harvard_Yard); an adjoining campus in the [Allston](/article/en/Allston) neighborhood of [Boston](/article/en/Boston) across the [Charles River](/article/en/Charles_River); and the medical campus in Boston's [Longwood Medical Area](/article/en/Longwood_Medical_Area).

Harvard's [endowment](/article/en/Financial_endowment), valued at $50.7 billion as of 2023, makes it the wealthiest academic institution in the world. [Harvard Library](/article/en/Harvard_Library), with more than 20 million volumes, is the world's largest academic library system.

Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers include 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, 162 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists, 14 Turing Award winners, 48 Pulitzer Prize winners, 369 Rhodes Scholars, 252 Marshall Scholars, and numerous other distinguished individuals. Harvard students and alumni have also won 10 Academy Awards and 110 Olympic medals, including 46 gold medals.

## History

### Colonial Era

Harvard was founded in 1636 as "New College" by a vote of the [Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony](/article/en/Massachusetts_General_Court). The institution acquired British North America's first known printing press in 1638. The same year, John Harvard, a Puritan clergyman who had emigrated from England, bequeathed the emerging college £780 and his library of about 320 volumes. In 1639, the college was renamed "Harvard College" in his honor.

The [Harvard Charter of 1650](/article/en/Harvard_Charter_of_1650) established the [Harvard Corporation](/article/en/President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College) (officially the President and Fellows of Harvard College), the college's governing body, which is now the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere.

Harvard's early curriculum was based on the English university model exemplified by the [University of Cambridge](/article/en/University_of_Cambridge), where many colonial Massachusetts leaders had studied. The college trained many Puritan ministers and offered a classical education based on the trivium and quadrivium.

From 1681 to 1701, [Increase Mather](/article/en/Increase_Mather), a Puritan clergyman, served as Harvard's sixth president. In 1708, [John Leverett](/article/en/John_Leverett_the_Younger) became Harvard's seventh president and the first president who was not a clergyman, marking a shift away from Puritanism toward intellectual independence.

The earliest known official seal of Harvard featured three open books arranged around a central chevron with the motto "IN CHRISTI GLORIAM" ("To the glory of Christ"), reflecting the original religious mission of the institution. In 1885, the university adopted a revised design known as the Appleton Seal, featuring a triangular shield with three open books and the motto "VERITAS" ("Truth").

### 19th Century

In the 19th century, Harvard was influenced by [Enlightenment](/article/en/Age_of_Enlightenment) ideas, including reason and free will, which were spreading among Congregational ministers. This created tension with more traditionalist, [Calvinist](/article/en/Calvinism) parties.

After the death of [David Tappan](/article/en/David_Tappan), the Hollis Professor of Divinity, in 1803 and Harvard's eleventh president [Joseph Willard](/article/en/Joseph_Willard) in 1804, a struggle broke out over their replacements. In 1805, [Henry Ware](/article/en/Henry_Ware_Sr.) was elected to replace Tappan, and in 1807, the liberal [Samuel Webber](/article/en/Samuel_Webber) was appointed as Harvard's 13th president, representing a shift from traditional ideas to more liberal, [Arminian](/article/en/Arminianism) ideas.

In 1816, Harvard launched new language programs in French and Spanish, appointing [George Ticknor](/article/en/George_Ticknor) as the university's first professor for these languages.

From 1869 to 1909, Charles William Eliot, Harvard's 21st president, decreased the historically favored position of Christianity in the curriculum, opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot influenced the secularization of U.S. higher education, he was motivated primarily by [Transcendentalist](/article/en/Transcendentalism) and [Unitarian](/article/en/Unitarianism) convictions influenced by [William Ellery Channing](/article/en/William_Ellery_Channing), [Ralph Waldo Emerson](/article/en/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson), and others.

In the late 19th century, Harvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers. In 1879, [Radcliffe College](/article/en/Radcliffe_College) was established as a women's college affiliated with Harvard.

### 20th Century

In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities. For the first few decades of the 20th century, the Harvard student body was predominantly "old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians," according to sociologist [Jerome Karabel](/article/en/Jerome_Karabel).

In 1923, a year after the proportion of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, [A. Lawrence Lowell](/article/en/Abbott_Lawrence_Lowell), Harvard's 22nd president, unsuccessfully proposed capping the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories.

Between 1933 and 1953, Harvard was led by [James B. Conant](/article/en/James_B._Conant), the university's 23rd president, who reinvigorated creative scholarship to ensure Harvard's preeminence among emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy and developed programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1945, under Conant's leadership, an influential report titled "General Education in a Free Society" was published, and women were first admitted to the medical school.

Between 1945 and 1960, admissions policies were standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students. Harvard became accessible to striving middle-class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, though Black, Hispanic, and Asian students remained underrepresented. Over the second half of the 20th century, however, the university became incrementally more diverse.

During World War II, women from Radcliffe College began attending classes alongside male Harvard students. Since 1971, Harvard controlled undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe's women. In 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard University, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

### 21st Century

On July 1, 2007, [Drew Gilpin Faust](/article/en/Drew_Gilpin_Faust), dean of the Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's 28th president and the university's first female president. On July 1, 2018, Faust retired and [Lawrence Bacow](/article/en/Lawrence_Bacow) became Harvard's 29th president.

In February 2023, approximately 6,000 Harvard workers attempted to organize a union.

Bacow retired in June 2023, and on July 1, [Claudine Gay](/article/en/Claudine_Gay), a Harvard professor in the Government and African American Studies departments and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became Harvard's 30th president. Gay's presidency was short-lived; in January 2024, just six months after taking office, she resigned following allegations of antisemitism and plagiarism. Gay was succeeded by [Alan Garber](/article/en/Alan_Garber), the university's provost, who was appointed interim president. In August 2024, the university announced that Garber would be appointed Harvard's 31st president through the end of the 2026–27 academic year.

In 2023, Harvard revealed findings from an investigation into its historical connections with slavery, showing that in its first 150 years (until 1783 when slavery became illegal in Massachusetts), university faculty members owned about 80 slaves. The university established a fund of $100 million to support research and educational projects on this topic.

Following the [October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel](/article/en/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel), a group of 34 student organizations signed a petition condemning Israel. Subsequently, several major donors, including [Batia and Idan Ofer](/article/en/Idan_Ofer) and [Bill Ackman](/article/en/Bill_Ackman), withdrew their support from the university. In December 2023, President Gay, along with the presidents of the [University of Pennsylvania](/article/en/University_of_Pennsylvania) and [MIT](/article/en/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology), testified before the [U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce](/article/en/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce) regarding antisemitism on campus. Gay's testimony was widely criticized for her reluctance to clearly define antisemitism as a violation of university policy, contributing to the pressure that led to her resignation.

In January 2024, Jewish students filed a lawsuit against the university claiming it failed to act against antisemitism on campus. In January 2025, Harvard reached a settlement agreement with some of the plaintiffs, agreeing to adopt the [International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism](/article/en/Working_Definition_of_Antisemitism), establish an official partnership with a university in Israel, create a mechanism for handling complaints about antisemitism, allow pro-Israel events on campus, and recognize that for many Jews, Zionism is an integral part of their identity.

In April 2025, the United States federal government under President [Donald Trump](/article/en/Donald_Trump) threatened to withhold nearly $9 billion in government funds from Harvard unless the university complied with demands to modify many of its policies. This followed student protests against the [Gaza war](/article/en/2023–2024_Israel–Hamas_war). When Harvard resisted, the U.S. Department of Education froze $2.3 billion in federal funds, and the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host international students. Harvard responded by filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the freezing of funds was unconstitutional.

## Campuses

### Cambridge

The 209-acre (85 ha) main campus of Harvard University is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about three miles (five km) west-northwest of downtown Boston. The Yard houses several Harvard buildings, including four libraries (Houghton, Lamont, Pusey, and Widener), Massachusetts Hall (built 1718-1720, the university's oldest standing building), Memorial Church, and University Hall.

Harvard Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including Sever Hall, Harvard Hall, and freshman dormitories. Upperclassmen live in twelve residential houses located south of Harvard Yard near the Charles River and on Radcliffe Quadrangle, which formerly housed Radcliffe College students. Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.

Also on the main Cambridge campus are the Law School, Divinity School (theology), Engineering and Applied Science School, Design School (architecture), Education School, Kennedy School (public policy), Extension schools, and the Radcliffe Institute. Harvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.

### Allston

Harvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in the Allston section of Boston across the John W. Weeks Bridge, which connects the Allston and Cambridge campuses.

The university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge. Plans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.

In 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences expanded into the new Allston-based Science and Engineering Complex (SEC), which covers more than 500,000 square feet. The SEC is adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and Harvard Innovation Labs, and is designed to encourage technology and life science-focused startups and collaborations with established companies.

### Longwood

The university's Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.

Several Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, including Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout Greater Boston.

### Other Locations

Harvard owns several properties beyond its main campuses:

- [Dumbarton Oaks](/article/en/Dumbarton_Oaks) research library in Washington, D.C.
- [Harvard Forest](/article/en/Harvard_Forest) in Petersham, Massachusetts
- Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts
- The [Villa I Tatti](/article/en/Villa_I_Tatti) research center in Florence, Italy
- The Center for Hellenic Studies in Greece
- The Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China
- [Arnold Arboretum](/article/en/Arnold_Arboretum) in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston

## Organization and Administration

### Governance

Harvard is governed by a combination of its [Board of Overseers](/article/en/Harvard_Board_of_Overseers) and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard Corporation). These two bodies, in turn, appoint the President of Harvard University.

There are approximately 16,000 staff and faculty, including 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors. As of 2025, Harvard differs from its peer universities in two significant ways: it does not make its governing statutes publicly available, and it does not have an academic senate like most of its peers, though it is currently attempting to create one.

### Endowment

Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023. During the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced budget cuts, including temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex. The endowment has since recovered.

About $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations. Harvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Endowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue comes from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.

### Divestment

Since the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in South Africa during apartheid, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.

In the late 1980s, during the disinvestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic shantytown on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown. In response to pressure, the university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million out of a total of $400 million between 1986 and 1987.

## Academics

### Teaching and Learning

Harvard is a large, highly residential research university offering 50 undergraduate majors (called "concentrations" at Harvard), 134 graduate degrees, and 32 professional degrees. During the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.

Harvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus. To graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester. In most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis. Though some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, with an academic staff of 1,211 as of 2019, is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties and a faculty attached to the Radcliffe Institute.

There are four Harvard joint programs with [MIT](/article/en/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology), including the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, established in 1999 when Radcliffe College merged with Harvard, is not a degree-granting school.

### Research

Harvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and a preeminent research university with "very high" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine, according to the [Carnegie Classification](/article/en/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education).

The medical school consistently ranks first among medical schools for research, and biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school and its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes. In 2019, the medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the [National Institutes of Health](/article/en/National_Institutes_of_Health), more than twice that of any other university.

### Libraries

Harvard Library, the largest academic library system in the world with 20.4 million holdings, is centered in [Widener Library](/article/en/Widener_Library) in Harvard Yard. It includes approximately 80 individual libraries around the world with a combined staff of more than 800 librarians and personnel.

[Houghton Library](/article/en/Houghton_Library), the [Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America](/article/en/Schlesinger_Library), and the [Harvard University Archives](/article/en/Harvard_University_Archives) consist principally of rare and unique materials. The nation's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases is stored in Pusey Library on Harvard Yard, which is open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in [Harvard-Yenching Library](/article/en/Harvard-Yenching_Library).

## Reputation and Rankings

Harvard University is accredited by the [New England Commission of Higher Education](/article/en/New_England_Commission_of_Higher_Education). Since the founding of the [Academic Ranking of World Universities](/article/en/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities) (ARWU) in 2003, Harvard has consistently ranked first in each of its annual rankings of the world's colleges and universities. Similarly, the [Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings](/article/en/Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings), published from 2004 to 2009, ranked Harvard first in the world each year. Since 2011, Harvard has continued to rank first in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

Harvard was also ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Columbia, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2023 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance.

Among rankings of specific indicators, Harvard topped both the University Ranking by Academic Performance in 2019–20 and Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities in 2011, which measured universities' numbers of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune Global 500 companies. According to annual polls by [The Princeton Review](/article/en/The_Princeton_Review), Harvard is consistently among the top two most commonly named "dream colleges" in the United States for both students and parents.

In 2019, Harvard's engineering school was ranked the third-best school in the world for engineering and technology by Times Higher Education. In international relations, [Foreign Policy](/article/en/Foreign_Policy) magazine ranks Harvard best in the world at the undergraduate level and second in the world at the graduate level, behind Georgetown University's [Walsh School of Foreign Service](/article/en/Edmund_A._Walsh_School_of_Foreign_Service).

According to the 2023 [U.S. News & World Report](/article/en/U.S._News_&_World_Report) rankings, Harvard is the second most selective undergraduate institution in the United States, after [Caltech](/article/en/California_Institute_of_Technology), with an acceptance rate of approximately 3%.

## Student Life

### Student Government

The Undergraduate Council represented Harvard College undergraduate students until it was dissolved in 2022 and replaced by the Undergraduate Association. The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.

### Student Media

[The Harvard Crimson](/article/en/The_Harvard_Crimson), founded in 1873 and run entirely by Harvard undergraduate students, is the university's primary student newspaper. Many notable alumni have worked at the Crimson, including two U.S. presidents, [Franklin D. Roosevelt](/article/en/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) (AB, 1903) and [John F. Kennedy](/article/en/John_F._Kennedy) (AB 1940).

Other student publications include [The Harvard Lampoon](/article/en/Harvard_Lampoon), America's oldest satirical magazine, and [WHRB](/article/en/WHRB), a student-run FM radio station (95.3 MHz).

### Athletics

Harvard College competes in the [NCAA Division I](/article/en/NCAA_Division_I) [Ivy League](/article/en/Ivy_League) conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country. Harvard and the other seven Ivy League universities are prohibited from offering athletic scholarships. The school color is crimson.

#### National Championships

In the NCAA Division I era, which began in 1973, Harvard Crimson teams have won five NCAA Division I championships as of 2024: men's ice hockey in 1989, women's lacrosse in 1990, women's rowing in 2003, and men's fencing in 2006 and 2024. Including the pre-NCAA era, Harvard has won 159 national championships across all sports. Its men's squash team holds the record for the most national collegiate championships in the sport. Harvard's first national championship came in 1880, when its track and field team won the national championship.

#### Rivalries

Harvard's athletic programs maintain a long-standing rivalry with [Yale](/article/en/Yale_University) in all sports, especially in college football, where Harvard and Yale compete in an annual football rivalry known as "[The Game](/article/en/Harvard–Yale_football_rivalry)," which has been played 139 times as of 2024, dating back to its first meeting in 1875.

Every two years, Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined [Oxford](/article/en/University_of_Oxford) and [Cambridge](/article/en/University_of_Cambridge) team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.

In men's ice hockey, Harvard maintains a historic rivalry with [Cornell](/article/en/Cornell_University), which dates back to their first meeting in 1910. The two teams play twice annually.

In men's rugby, Harvard maintains a rivalry with [McGill University](/article/en/McGill_University), as demonstrated by the biennial Harvard-McGill rugby games, alternately played in Montreal and Cambridge.

### Housing

Harvard operates a residential house system for upperclassmen, established by President A. Lawrence Lowell in the 1930s to combat social stratification among students. First-year students live in dormitories in or near Harvard Yard, while upperclassmen are assigned to one of twelve residential houses.

Nine River Houses are located along the Charles River:
- Adams House (named after U.S. President John Adams)
- Dunster House (after Harvard's first president Henry Dunster)
- Eliot House (after Harvard President Charles Eliot)
- Kirkland House (after Harvard President John Kirkland)
- Leverett House (after Harvard President John Leverett)
- Lowell House (after Harvard President Abbott Lowell)
- Mather House (after Harvard President Increase Mather)
- Quincy House (after Harvard President Josiah Quincy III)
- Winthrop House (after John Winthrop)

Three Quad Houses are located in the former Radcliffe area:
- Cabot House (named after Thomas and Virginia Cabot)
- Currier House (named after Radcliffe graduate Audrey Bruce Currier)
- Pforzheimer House (named after Carl and Carol Pforzheimer)

Each house has faculty deans, resident tutors, a dining hall, library, and recreational facilities, creating a microcommunity within the larger university.

### Traditions

One notable Harvard tradition is "Primal Scream," held on the night before the last day of final exams each semester. Students run naked through Harvard Yard, sometimes wearing capes and masks. A band performs before the start to energize the event, which draws many spectators.

## In Popular Culture

Harvard's reputation as a center of elite achievement or elitist privilege has made it a frequent literary and cinematic backdrop. "In the grammar of film, Harvard has come to mean both tradition, and a certain amount of stuffiness," film critic Paul Sherman noted in 2010.

### Literature

In contemporary literature, Harvard features prominently in multiple novels, including:

- [The Sound and the Fury](/article/en/The_Sound_and_the_Fury) (1929) and [Absalom, Absalom!](/article/en/Absalom,_Absalom!) (1936) by [William Faulkner](/article/en/William_Faulkner), both depicting Harvard student life
- [Of Time and the River](/article/en/Of_Time_and_the_River) (1935) by [Thomas Wolfe](/article/en/Thomas_Wolfe)
- [The Late George Apley](/article/en/The_Late_George_Apley) (1937) by [John P. Marquand](/article/en/John_P._Marquand)
- [The Second Happiest Day](/article/en/The_Second_Happiest_Day) (1953) by John P. Marquand

### Films

Harvard University features prominently in the plots of multiple major films, including:

- [Love Story](/article/en/Love_Story_(1970_film)) (1970)
- [The Paper Chase](/article/en/The_Paper_Chase_(film)) (1973)
- [A Small Circle of Friends](/article/en/A_Small_Circle_of_Friends) (1980)
- [With Honors](/article/en/With_Honors) (1994)
- [Legally Blonde](/article/en/Legally_Blonde) (2001)
- [Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story](/article/en/Homeless_to_Harvard:_The_Liz_Murray_Story) (2003)
- [The Social Network](/article/en/The_Social_Network) (2010)

Harvard is selective about allowing filming on its campus. After damage caused during the filming of "Love Story" in 1970 and "A Small Circle of Friends" in 1980, the university has rejected most requests to film on its grounds.

## Interesting Facts

- The bells of Harvard University's carillon were previously located in the [Danilov Monastery](/article/en/Danilov_Monastery) in Moscow and were sold by the Soviet government in the 1930s. In 2007, the historical bells were returned to the monastery in exchange for exact copies cast in Voronezh, Russia.

- In Harvard Yard stands a statue of John Harvard created by sculptor [Daniel Chester French](/article/en/Daniel_Chester_French). Students call it the "Statue of Three Lies" because: the seated man is not actually John Harvard but a student named Sherman Hoar who modeled for the sculptor; John Harvard was not the founder of the university but a major early benefactor; and the university was founded in 1636, not 1638 as indicated on the statue.

- [Asteroid 736 Harvard](/article/en/736_Harvard), discovered in 1912, is named after Harvard University.

- The markings on the Harvard Bridge are made in a rare unit of length called "smoots." In 1958, MIT students measured the bridge using the body length of freshman Oliver Smoot, determining it to be "364.4 smoots plus one ear" (about 620 meters). When the bridge was reconstructed in 1988, authorities initially erased the markings, but police requested they be restored as they were useful reference points for reporting incidents.
