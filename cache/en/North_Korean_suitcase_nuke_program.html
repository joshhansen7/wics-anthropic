# Atomic Demolition Munitions

Atomic demolition munitions (ADMs), colloquially known as nuclear land mines or nuclear fugases, are small nuclear explosive devices. ADMs were developed for both military and civilian purposes. As weapons, they were designed to be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. Apart from testing, however, they have never been used for either purpose.

## Overview

Nuclear land mines consist of a nuclear charge, initiation system, safety device, activation system, and power sources. They were developed as tactical nuclear weapons to deny large areas or specific terrain points to delay enemy attacks. The explosive yields of these devices ranged widely, from as little as 10 tons TNT equivalent to as much as 15 kilotons, depending on the specific model.

Unlike conventional nuclear weapons delivered by missiles, rockets, or artillery shells, ADMs were intended to be emplaced by soldiers directly at strategic locations. Due to their relatively small size and light weight, they could be transported and set up by military engineers or special forces teams, then detonated on command or by timer to create massive obstructions.

## Military Use

The primary military purpose of ADMs was to destroy key terrain features or choke points such as bridges, dams, mountain passes, tunnels, major highways, and other strategic locations to create physical as well as radiological obstacles to the movement of enemy forces. This would serve to delay advancing troops and channel them into prepared killing zones.

During the Cold War, NATO proposed creating a nuclear-mine belt along the borders of West Germany and within its territory. The charges would be installed at points of strategic importance for advancing troops. It was assumed that the detonation of all charges would create a zone of radioactive contamination and difficult-to-overcome obstacles, which would delay the advance of Soviet troops by two to three days.

According to official accounts, the United States deployed ADMs overseas in Italy and West Germany (particularly in the [Fulda Gap](/article/en/Fulda_Gap)) during the Cold War. The most modern types ([SADM](/article/en/Special_Atomic_Demolition_Munition) and [MADM](/article/en/Medium_Atomic_Demolition_Munition)) were deployed in South Korea. Seymour Hersh referred to the deployment of ADMs along the [Golan Heights](/article/en/Golan_Heights) by Israel in the early 1980s.

In 1985, reportedly 93 of these weapons were operational in Europe. Other sources mention approximately 300 ADMs in West Germany in 1985. The exact deployment locations remain classified to this day.

The background to these deployment plans was the then-superiority of the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces. Withstanding an Eastern Bloc attack with conventional weapons was not reliably possible due to the force ratio. Therefore, NATO reserved the right to stop such an attack with nuclear weapons as well. In addition to ADMs, nuclear-armed short-range missiles were primarily intended for this purpose.

German commanders had concerns about deploying ADMs on German soil, as the consequences were incalculable. In 1960, during the MAKE FAST VIII engineer exercise, German officers refused to deploy tactical nuclear weapons like ADMs, which caused irritation among British, Dutch, and Belgian exercise participants. However, the [Bundeswehr](/article/en/Bundeswehr) leadership had to yield to NATO demands and include ADMs in defense planning and scout appropriate deployment points. As a concession from NATO, ADMs were to be used only east of the Weser River and not in or near populated areas. 

The USA was not willing to delegate the release authority for ADMs to local military leaders. This diminished their operational value, as they could not be deployed quickly enough, and they were ultimately removed from NATO's then-secret operational plans in the mid-1960s by Johann Adolf Graf von Kielmansegg, the first German CINCENT.

From 1969 onward, Helmut Schmidt, as Minister of Defense, opposed the use of atomic mines and prevented implementation of the planned mining.

ADMs and nuclear short-range missiles like the French Pluton were critically discussed in German public discourse during the 1970s and 1980s, as they would have been deployed on the presumed battlefield of Germany.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989, these weapons lost their military significance. With the elimination of the military threat from the Warsaw Pact, the scenario of a surprise attack by a superior conventional army no longer existed.

The Soviet Union also possessed such weapons. However, due to their already existing conventional superiority, they did not have significant strategic importance there.

## Civilian Use

ADMs have never been used commercially although similar small devices, often modified to cut down on fission yield and maximize fusion, have been deeply buried to put out gas well fires as part of the Soviet test program.

The Soviet Union tested the use of nuclear devices for mining and natural gas extraction (stimulating gas flow in a similar manner to [fracking](/article/en/Hydraulic_fracturing)) on several occasions starting in the mid-1960s, as part of the [Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy](/article/en/Nuclear_Explosions_for_the_National_Economy) program. 

Tests for similar purposes were carried out in the United States under [Operation Plowshare](/article/en/Operation_Plowshare), but due to radioactive contamination caused by the tests, no direct commercial use was made of the technology although they were successful at nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust by [Vibroseis](/article/en/Vibroseis), which has helped mining company prospecting.

Given current concerns about radiation dangers, it seems unlikely that any non-military use of these explosives will exist in the future.

## United States ADM Types

In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed several different types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the [W54](/article/en/W54), a cylinder 40 by 60 cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 23 kg (50 lb). It was fired by a mechanical timer and had a variable yield equivalent to between 10 tons and 1 kt of TNT. A field non-variable yield version of the W54 nuclear device (called the "Mk-54 Davy Crockett" warhead for the M-388 Crockett round) was used in the [Davy Crockett Weapon System](/article/en/Davy_Crockett_(nuclear_device)).

The United States developed the following ADM types:

* W7/ADM-B (c. 1954–67)
* T4 ADM (1957–63) gun type
* W30/Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition (1961–66)
* W31/ADM (1960–65)
* W45/Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (1964–84)
* W54/Special Atomic Demolition Munition (1965–89)

### TADM

The Mk 30 Mod 1 Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition (TADM) was a portable atomic bomb, consisting of a Mk 30 warhead installed in a XM-113 case. The XM-113 was 26 inches (660 mm) in diameter and 70 inches (1,800 mm) long, and looked like corrugated culvert pipe. The whole system weighed 840 pounds (380 kg). Production of the TADM started in 1961 and all were removed from stockpile by 1966. 

A weapons effect test of the TADM was made in the 1962 Johnny Boy ("Johnnie Boy") shot of the Dominic II series (which is more accurately referred to as Operation Sunbeam), the yield of Johnny Boy/Johnnie Boy was about 0.5 kt. A preceding ADM test that resulted in a comparable yield, was test shot "Danny Boy" of [Operation Nougat](/article/en/Operation_Nougat), also producing a yield of about 0.5 kiloton.

### SADM

The [Special Atomic Demolition Munition](/article/en/Special_Atomic_Demolition_Munition) (SADM) was a family of man-portable nuclear weapons fielded by the US military in the 1960s, but never used in actual combat. The US Army planned to use the weapons in Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion. US Army Engineers would use the weapon to irradiate, destroy, and deny key routes of communication through limited terrain such as the Fulda Gap. Troops were trained to parachute into Soviet occupied western Europe with the SADM and destroy power plants, bridges, and dams.

The weapon was designed to allow one person to parachute from any type of aircraft carrying the weapon package and place it in a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. Another parachutist without a weapon package would follow the first to provide support as needed.

The two-person team would place the weapon package in the target location, set the timer, and swim out into the ocean where they would be retrieved by a submarine or a high-speed surface water craft.

### MADM

The [Medium Atomic Demolition Munition](/article/en/Medium_Atomic_Demolition_Munition) (MADM) was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed to be used as nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low explosive yield from a W45 warhead, between 1 and 15 kilotons. Each MADM weighed around 400 lb (181 kg) total. They were produced between 1965 and 1986.

## Russian Controversy with ADMs

In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia developed a deep cooperation designed to assure the security of Russia's nuclear arsenal. While a number of steps were taken to consolidate and improve the security of Russia's strategic nuclear arms, particularly under the [Cooperative Threat Reduction](/article/en/Cooperative_Threat_Reduction) program, concern remained over the security of the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal. 

In particular, a serious debate arose over the status of what are known as "suitcase nuclear weapons", very small Soviet-era nuclear devices. The term [suitcase nuke](/article/en/Suitcase_nuke) is generally used to describe any type of small, man-portable nuclear device although there is serious debate as to the validity of the term itself. In a worst case analysis, a suitcase nuke would be small enough to be hand-carried into a major population or leadership center undetected and then detonated. Although, by most accounts, the yield of such a device is likely far less than ten kilotons, its combined effects may have the potential to kill tens of thousands, if not more. 

There is a great deal of confusion over just how many of these suitcase devices exist or if they even exist at all. By some accounts, the Soviet Union built hundreds of these devices, of which several dozen were missing. Based on other reports, suitcase nukes were never built in large numbers or were never deployed.

There is no definitive open source information on the number, location, security, or status of these suitcase nuclear bombs. No Soviet suitcase bomb or any of its presumed components has ever been found, much less used, in the three decades after the collapse of the USSR. As of 2018, it is likely they would not work or would fizzle at worst by lack of the required specialized maintenance common to all nuclear weapons, if they ever existed.

### Frontline Broadcast About Suitcase Nukes

In May 1997 General Alexander Lebed told an American Congressional delegation that Russia had lost dozens of atomic demolition units. In a later interview with American investigative program 60 Minutes he revised his estimate, saying that they had lost more than 100 units - a claim that the Russian government rejected.

On 23 February 1999, the PBS investigative program Frontline aired a special on Russian nuclear security that included a series of interviews with several of the individuals who spoke publicly during the 1997 debate on suitcase nukes. Alexei Yablokov appeared and reasserted his position that some number of small atomic charges had been built, even going so far as to speak of their weight ("thirty kilos, forty kilos"). Yablokov accused the Russian government of misleading the public on the situation, pointing to the inconsistencies in denials by the FSB, MINATOM, and the information that was publicly available on the Internet.

On the same program, Congressman Curt Weldon recounted a meeting he held in December 1997 with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. During this meeting, Weldon asked Sergeyev specifically about the small ADM devices. According to Weldon, Sergeyev's response was: "Yes, we did build them, we are in the process of destroying them, and by the year 2000 we will have destroyed all of our small atomic demolition devices." Weldon went on to express confidence in Sergeyev's statement but also raised concern as to whether or not the Russian government had accounted for all of its nuclear devices.

Frontline also featured several American and Russian experts and officials who presented differing views on the subject. General Vladimir Dvorkin, a former officer in the Strategic Rocket Forces and subsequently Director of the Fourth Central Research Institute in Moscow, admitted that "some small devices existed in the United States and Russia" but that something that small would have a very limited shelf life and would have little deterrent value. Dvorkin discounted the validity of statements, saying "... Lebed is probably the least informed person as far as this topic is concerned ... an expert in military folklore." 

The former commander of U.S. nuclear forces, retired General Eugene Habiger, also appeared on Frontline and expressed doubt about the size of such devices, calling the term suitcase "a little optimistic." Additionally, Habiger spoke of the systems set up by the Russians to track their nuclear weapons, saying "If the Russians were as deadly serious about the accountability of the nuclear weapons that I saw and have been involved with, I can only surmise that they have the same concerns with the smaller weapons."

### Suitcase Nukes and Bin Laden

By late 1999, the concern had expanded from nuclear armed Chechen rebels to include concerns about [Osama bin Laden](/article/en/Osama_bin_Laden)'s [al-Qaeda](/article/en/Al-Qaeda) network. Although unsubstantiated, some reports suggested that bin Laden had already managed to acquire weapons from the Russian nuclear arsenal. 

In August 1999, Voice of America broadcast a story about the threat posed by bin Laden. In it, Yossef Bodansky, an American terrorism analyst, author, and head of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Non-Conventional Warfare claimed that he had learned, through sources in Russia and the Middle East, that bin Laden had "a few of the ex-Soviet 'suitcase' bombs acquired through the Chechens.″ 

Two months later, on 5 October, the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda published an interview in which Bodansky, citing "various intelligence sources," claimed that bin Laden had acquired, through Kazakhstan, "from several to twenty tactical nuclear warheads." Bodansky also claimed that bin Laden had attempted to buy "nuclear suitcases" in Kazakhstan. 

In the same article, the director of the Atomic Energy Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan declared that all nuclear weapons had been removed "long ago" from Kazakhstan and that suitcase nuclear devices were never built in Kazakh territory. The head of counterintelligence for the Kazakhstani Committee on National Security told Komsomolskaya Pravda that all nuclear weapons were removed from Kazakhstan in 1995 in accordance with the START I treaty and denied reports that bin Laden had attempted to purchase nuclear weapons there. 

Bodansky's claims surfaced again on 25 October 1999 when The Jerusalem Report published an article on bin Laden and suitcase nuclear devices. In this report, Bodansky's claim of "a few to twenty" weapons was repeated. In addition, Bodansky claimed that bin Laden had purchased the weapons using "$30 million in cash and two tons of Afghan heroin." Very little information is available to back Bodansky's claims, however, and they remain in doubt.

### Suitcase Nukes Concerns Post-9/11

Following the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States, fresh attention was focused on al-Qaeda's desire for [weapons of mass destruction](/article/en/Weapons_of_mass_destruction) but with more urgency than in the past. A serious concern was that al-Qaeda terrorists might attempt to obtain Russian warheads or weapon-usable nuclear materials. 

Former GRU Colonel Stanislav Lunev's 1998 statements were resurrected following the attacks. During an appearance on CBS, Lunev reasserted his claim that suitcase bombs existed, even going so far as to claim that bin Laden had obtained several of the devices from the former Soviet Union. In the same segment, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution discounted Lunev's claims: "Our view is that this is not a major worry. If those devices ever existed, they were under the control of the Soviet state, and not available to terrorists." 

On 20 December 2001 UPI reported that the FBI had stepped up its investigation into terrorist access to Russian nuclear stockpiles. Representative Weldon, once again at the forefront of the debate, stated "Do I think he [bin Laden] has a [sic] small atomic demolition munitions, which were built by the Soviets in the Cold War? Probably doubtful."

On 17 January 2002, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, told Interfax it would be impossible for terrorists to construct a portable nuclear weapon, citing a lack of "necessary potential and materials." The Interfax report went on to state "major nuclear powers have an effective system of control over miniature nuclear charges, which weigh a total of several dozen kilograms." According to Rumyantsev "all of these [miniature nuclear devices] are registered ... it is technically impossible for such charges to find their way into the hands of terrorists."

## In Culture

Nuclear mines are mentioned in the science fiction novella "The Land of Crimson Clouds" by the [Strugatsky brothers](/article/en/Arkady_and_Boris_Strugatsky).

Nuclear-mine barriers feature in the science fiction novella "Inhabited Island" by the Strugatsky brothers and in the second part of the film duology based on it — Fyodor Bondarchuk's film "Inhabited Island: The Confrontation."
