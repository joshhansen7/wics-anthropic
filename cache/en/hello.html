# Hello

Hello is a common greeting or salutation in the [English language](/article/en/English_language). It is used in both oral and written communication, especially among acquaintances or friends. The word has become one of the most universally recognized greetings worldwide, popularized particularly through its use in telephone conversations and the global spread of English-speaking culture.

## Meaning and Usage

### As Different Parts of Speech

As an [interjection](/article/en/interjection), "hello" serves multiple purposes:
- A greeting similar to "hi," "good day," "good morning," or "good evening"
- A telephone greeting
- A way to get someone's attention (similar to "hey")
- An expression of surprise
- A way to address someone behaving strangely ("hey now")
- An indication that someone wasn't paying attention or said something foolish

As a [noun](/article/en/noun), it means "a greeting of hello," with the plural form being "hellos."

As a [verb](/article/en/verb), it means "to say hello."

### Usage Patterns

The German Wikipedia notes that the intonation, facial expressions, and gestures of the speaker are essential for determining the exact meaning of "hello." The substantiated form "ein Hallo" (with stress on the second syllable) describes a (joyful) noisy commotion ("He was greeted with a great hallo").

According to language expert David Thayne (cited in the Japanese Wikipedia), native English speakers don't typically distinguish between "Hello" and "Hi" in terms of formality. However, there is a common pattern where people respond with "Hi" when greeted with "Hello," and respond with "Hello" when greeted with "Hi."

In recent years, particularly in Taiwan, the word has taken on additional cultural meanings. On Taiwanese student websites like [PTT Bulletin Board System](/article/en/PTT_Bulletin_Board_System), the phrase "是在哈囉？" (shì zài hā luō?, meaning "What's going on?" or literally "Are you hello-ing?") has become a common way to mock awkward situations.

## Etymology and History

### Origins

According to the [Oxford English Dictionary](/article/en/Oxford_English_Dictionary), "hello" is an alteration of "hallo" or "hollo," which came from [Old High German](/article/en/Old_High_German) "halâ, holâ," the emphatic imperative of "halôn, holôn" meaning "to fetch," and was especially used in hailing a ferryman. The OED also connects the development of "hello" to the influence of an earlier form, "holla," whose origin is in the French "holà" (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French "là" meaning 'there').

The Japanese Wikipedia adds that the etymology can be traced back to the word "hail," which was used for greetings since medieval times and appears in [William Shakespeare's](/article/en/William_Shakespeare) works. "Hail" was originally related to other words derived from "health" (e.g., "hale," "health," "whole"), and later evolved into derivatives like "hollo," "hallo," "halloa," and "holler."

The German Wikipedia notes that the imperative call "hallo" is old in both German and English, with the earliest literary evidence in German dating from the 15th century. Both "hallo" and the closely related "holla" come from Old High German "halōn, holōn," Middle High German "halen, holen, holn" for "to call, to fetch" (resulting in New High German "holen"). Both expressions are sonically intensified imperatives of this verb.

There is also a theory from the German Wikipedia suggesting a possible Hungarian origin. When testing the first American telephone exchange, which was developed by Hungarian scientists (specifically [Tivadar Puskás](/article/en/Tivadar_Puskás)), the word "hallom" (Hungarian: "I hear it") or "hallod" (Hungarian: "do you hear?") is said to have been used.

### First Documented Uses

"Hello" with that spelling was first attested in writing in the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut, according to the English Wikipedia. The Arabic Wikipedia similarly cites 1826 as the first use date.

Another early use was in an 1833 American book called "The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee," which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.

In the 1830s, when "Hello" began to be used more widely, it primarily expressed surprise or was used to get someone's attention. By 1848, it was being used by western pioneers during America's westward expansion. The Japanese Wikipedia notes that since "Hello" began as a word to call someone from a distance in the 19th century, it has the unusual characteristic in English of emphasizing the second syllable instead of the first. By the 1850s, there were confirmed examples of its use as a greeting.

### The Telephone Connection

The use of "hello" became widely popularized with the invention of the [telephone](/article/en/telephone). Before telephones connected people across different time zones, verbal greetings often included a time of day, such as "good morning." As telephones began connecting people in different time zones, greetings without time references gained popularity.

When [Alexander Graham Bell](/article/en/Alexander_Graham_Bell) invented the telephone in 1876, he initially used the nautical term "ahoy ahoy" as a greeting, borrowing the term used on ships. However, this greeting did not catch on. There is a myth that Bell used "hello" with his girlfriend Margaret Hello, but as the Japanese Wikipedia points out, Margaret Hello never actually existed.

[Thomas Edison](/article/en/Thomas_Edison) is credited with popularizing "hello" as a telephone greeting. According to multiple sources, Edison suggested "Hello!" on August 15, 1877, in a letter to T.B.A. David, president of Pittsburgh's Central District and Printing Telegraph Company:

"Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away. What you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00."

There's also a theory that "hello" became widely used because early telephone books listed it as the official greeting. For example, the first telephone book published in New Haven, Connecticut in 1878, "the District Telephone Company," clearly recommended starting conversations with "hulloa."

The first name tags to include "Hello" may have been in 1880 at [Niagara Falls](/article/en/Niagara_Falls), which was the site of the first telephone operators convention. By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as "hello-girls" because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.

### Variant Spellings

Hello might be derived from an older spelling variant, "hullo," which the American [Merriam-Webster dictionary](/article/en/Merriam-Webster) describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello," and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. "Hullo" is found in publications as early as 1803 and is still in use today.

Several variant spellings exist, including "hullo," "hallo," "hollo," "hullo," and (rarely) "hillo." In the 1920s, H.W. Fowler listed even more variants: "halloo," "hallo," "halloa," "halloo," "hello," "hillo," "hilloa," "holla," "holler," "hollo," "holloa," "hollow," "hullo," and noted that "the diversity of forms is bewildering..."

## Hello in Technology

### "Hello, World" Computer Program

Students learning a new [computer programming language](/article/en/Computer_programming_language) will often begin by writing a "[Hello, World!](/article/en/Hello_World_program)" program, which does nothing but issue the message "Hello, World!" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). This tradition has been used since the earliest programs and in many computer languages.

The practice was further popularized after being printed in an introductory chapter of the book "The C Programming Language" by [Brian Kernighan](/article/en/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis Ritchie](/article/en/Dennis_Ritchie). The book had reused an example taken from a 1974 memo by Kernighan at [Bell Laboratories](/article/en/Bell_Laboratories).

In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from [Willem Bilderdijk](/article/en/Willem_Bilderdijk) to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.

The Chinese Wikipedia notes that "Hello" corresponds to the Chinese greeting "你好" (nǐ hǎo), but the English word is now also commonly used in everyday Chinese conversations, including being transliterated as "哈囉" (hā luō).

## World Hello Day

According to the Japanese Wikipedia, in 1973, against the backdrop of armed conflict between Israel and Arab countries in October of that year (the [Yom Kippur War](/article/en/Yom_Kippur_War)), Michael McCormack and Brian McCormack, believing dialogue rather than armed force was important, called for the first "World Hello Day" on November 21 of that year. They used seven languages to address leaders and government officials of various countries. [World Hello Day](/article/en/World_Hello_Day) continues to be observed annually.
