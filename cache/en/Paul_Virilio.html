# Paul Virilio

Paul Virilio (French: [viʁiljo]; January 4, 1932 – September 10, 2018) was a French cultural theorist, urbanist, architect, and aesthetic philosopher. He is best known for his writings about technology as it has developed in relation to speed and power, with diverse references to architecture, the arts, the city and the military. Virilio was a prolific creator of neologisms, most notably his concept of "dromology," the study of the logic and impact of speed on society and culture.

## Biography

### Early Life and Education

Paul Virilio was born on January 4, 1932, in Paris, France, to an Italian communist father who had fled fascism in Italy and a Catholic Breton mother. During World War II, he experienced the bombing of Nantes by Allied aircraft, an event that profoundly affected him and shaped his later thinking: "We were bombed by the Allies. For a ten-year-old kid, there's something philosophical about it: those who kill us we love, those who occupy us we hate. I am the child of this perplexity, of this ambiguity" (from the French version). This experience introduced him to themes that would later become central to his work: war as a general state of the contemporary world, the speed of destruction, the annihilation of urban space, and the deadly power of technology.

After the war, Virilio trained as a master glassmaker at the École des métiers d'art in Paris while also attending lectures by philosophers Vladimir Jankélévitch and Raymond Aron at the [Sorbonne](/article/en/Sorbonne). He collaborated on stained glass works with [Henri Matisse](/article/en/Henri_Matisse) in Saint-Paul-de-Vence and [Georges Braque](/article/en/Georges_Braque) in Varengeville. In 1950, he converted to [Catholicism](/article/en/Catholicism).

### Military Service and Early Career

Virilio completed his military service as a cartographer in [Freiburg im Breisgau](/article/en/Freiburg_im_Breisgau) and was later recalled during the [Algerian War](/article/en/Algerian_War) in 1956. After his discharge, he began his career as a painter and stained glass artist.

With his wife, he ran an art gallery on rue de l'Ancienne Comédie before establishing their stained glass workshop on rue Rousselet in 1955. He became [Serge Rezvani's](/article/en/Serge_Rezvani) master glassmaker, creating stained glass windows for the St-Nicolas church in Oye-et-Pallet.

In 1958, he undertook a phenomenological study of military territories, particularly the bunkers of the [Atlantic Wall](/article/en/Atlantic_Wall), which would later form the basis for his exhibition and book "Bunker Archaeology."

### Architectural and Academic Career

In 1963, Virilio founded the Architecture Principe group with architect [Claude Parent](/article/en/Claude_Parent), sculptor Morice Lipsi, and painter Michel Carrade. The journal of the same name had 10 issues, followed by a manifesto for oblique architecture.

In 1965, he organized the "Exploration of the Future" exhibition at the [Arc-et-Senans saltworks](/article/en/Royal_Saltworks_at_Arc-et-Senans). The following year, with Claude Parent, he built the Sainte Bernadette du Banlay church in [Nevers](/article/en/Nevers), which experimented with obliqueness inside a concrete block, which many parishioners and visitors mistook for a bunker. In 1967, he designed the Aerospace Research Center for the Thomson-Houston company in Vélizy-Villacoublay.

In 1968, Virilio joined the École spéciale d'architecture (ESA) in Paris as a workshop director. He spent his entire career there until 1997, becoming a professor, then director, and later president. During his tenure, he invented the "triptych" teaching method: students had to submit a bad project, then one they considered good, and finally one that surpassed and enveloped the two previous ones.

In 1969, Virilio joined the editorial board of [Esprit](/article/en/Esprit_(magazine)) magazine, co-founded the journal Cause commune in 1972 with [Jean Baudrillard](/article/en/Jean_Baudrillard) and [Georges Perec](/article/en/Georges_Perec), and contributed to the journal Traverses from 1975. He directed the L'Espace critique collection at Éditions Galilée, in which he published Perec's "Species of Spaces" as well as works by [Félix Guattari](/article/en/Félix_Guattari) and [Ignacio Ramonet](/article/en/Ignacio_Ramonet), along with many of his own texts.

In 1975, he was the curator for the "Bunker Archaeology" exhibition at the [Museum of Decorative Arts](/article/en/Musée_des_Arts_Décoratifs,_Paris) in Paris.

In 1979, he co-founded the Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche de la paix et d'études stratégiques ("Interdisciplinary Center for Peace Research and Strategic Studies") with [Alain Joxe](/article/en/Alain_Joxe).

In 1998, Virilio began to teach intensive seminars at the [European Graduate School](/article/en/European_Graduate_School).

### Later Life and Social Engagement

In the 1980s, alongside Father Patrick Giros, Virilio advocated for the homeless and marginalized. In 1992, he was part of the High Committee for Housing Disadvantaged People, created at the request of [Abbé Pierre](/article/en/Abbé_Pierre). In 1993, he participated in launching the Urban Beacons competition, which aimed to create urban furniture allowing homeless people to access domiciliation, means of communication, and sanitary facilities.

In 1991, Virilio inaugurated "Speed," the first of several exhibitions he created for the Cartier Foundation. These were followed by "Unknown Quantity" in 2002 and "Native Land, Elsewhere Begins Here" in 2008.

After retiring to La Rochelle, Paul Virilio died on September 10, 2018, in Rueil-Malmaison from heart disease. On April 3, 2019, an Allée Paul Virilio was inaugurated in La Rochelle in his memory.

## Ideas

### Dromology

Virilio coined the term "dromology" (from the Greek dromos, meaning race or racetrack) to signify the "logic and impact of speed." Dromology is the study of how speed shapes society, culture, and individuals. For Virilio, speed is not merely a phenomenon but the relationship between phenomena.

As he explains: "Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation" (from the English version). Therefore, dromology "necessarily implies the study of the organisation of territory."

Virilio argues that speed brutally detaches us from reality, from others, and from ourselves, and carries within it a threat to humanity that must be understood to be warded off. Speed leads to:

1. An escape from the here and now
2. The annihilation of others, who merely pass by before disappearing
3. The decomposition of social bonds
4. The transformation of cities from places of social exchange to mere transit hubs
5. The absence of self-awareness

For Virilio, when speed increases, freedom decreases. While abstracting oneself from speed is a utopia, becoming aware of its effects implies a form of freedom.

### Speed and War

Virilio establishes a direct link between speed and violence, between speed and war. He argues that speed stems from war, and that the opposite of progress, because in its intimate essence it is an exterminating violence, a war not only against others but also against the world.

He defines three types of war:
1. Civil war
2. War between armies
3. War against civilians (waged by gangs, mercenaries, or terrorists)

Virilio observes that modern warfare has become a spectacle, with its images detached from the reality of destruction, leading to what he calls "cinematic derealization." For example, during the 1991 [Gulf War](/article/en/Gulf_War), "the message of this media war consists less in providing information about the reality of the current fighting than in promoting the possibility of future wars" (from the German version).

### Speed, Time, and Technology

For Virilio, new technologies have resulted in what he called "polar inertia" (a term that became well-known through his 1992 essay), the final stage of technologically mediated acceleration. In this stage, all-dominating telecommunications overcome barriers of space and time, where communicators no longer need to move, and the body responds with pathological symptoms such as burnout.

He argues that real time has surpassed real space, leading to general inertia. Global information in real time produces what he calls a "communism of affects" - planetary collective emotions that can result in an exacerbation of hatred, imprecations, and verbal and physical violence. In response, Virilio proposes a "grey ecology" that would be the economy of time, to rediscover temporal landmarks.

### Speed and Perception

Virilio can be considered a continuator of [Walter Benjamin's](/article/en/Walter_Benjamin) or [Edmund Husserl's](/article/en/Edmund_Husserl) reflections on the importance of historical circumstances in the organization of perception.

For him, art is no longer a representation but a presentation that leads to blindness. Real time replaces real space. The images of the destruction of the [World Trade Center](/article/en/World_Trade_Center) on September 11, 2001, exemplify what he calls the "aesthetics of disappearance," which makes absence itself disappear in favor of real time.

Virilio argued that the photographic or cinematographic lens has become the arbiter of truth and knowledge. Vision depends on the pixels of a computer screen, which have nothing in common with the real world and only produce statistical images, thus rational illusions. In his 1988 book "The Vision Machine," he predicted the production of images by machines for other machines, and the obsolescence of human perception due to [artificial intelligence](/article/en/Artificial_intelligence).

He extends this notion to representative democracy, which he sees being replaced by a presentative, even virtual democracy. During electoral campaigns, images become more powerful than words in creating consensus, moving from politically correct to optically correct, without the possibility of dissident or alternative images.

### Theory of the Accident

The notion of accident appears to Virilio as the ultimate revealer of the damage resulting from progress. The accident is no longer due to chance but is systemic and shows the other side of science. Speed turns the accident into a catastrophe that can end our era. Because under the assault of speed, our relationship to dimensions, to life-size, is disrupted.

Virilio proposes a science of accidents, possible as long as one accepts that any technological innovation will generate an accident in the future. For him, it is necessary to turn the accident around in order to continue inhabiting the world. His final projects involved building the first Museum of the Accident and creating a University of Disaster.

## Architecture

Virilio's architectural career began with his photographic research on the Atlantic Wall bunkers. This led him to think about space differently and to define a topological way of thinking under the influence of [Gestalt theory](/article/en/Gestalt_psychology). For him, the body engages space, and space must be redefined in relation to the body.

In 1964, he theorized oblique architecture with Claude Parent, which involves a continuous perception of space. One of their projects was a pendulum destabilizer: two inclined spaces in which they planned to confine themselves independently for 6 months to see how the slope could change spatial perception.

The Architecture principe agency of Parent and Virilio, later joined by [Jean Nouvel](/article/en/Jean_Nouvel), was active until 1968. The events of May 1968 led to a rupture between Virilio and Parent, characterized as a split between "a right-wing liberal anarchist and a worker's son, fervent Catholic, influenced by situationism."

The major achievement of oblique architecture is the Sainte-Bernadette du Banlay Church in Nevers, a bunker split in two with two inclined planes, reflecting the idea of a suspended negative dialectic.

## Reception and Criticism

### Critical Reception

Virilio's work has received mixed critical reception. [Jean Baudrillard](/article/en/Jean_Baudrillard), while drawing on Virilio's works in 1985, eventually stated in 1988 that Virilio's analyses were out of date as "Speed is out!", stating that immobility had set in because "all trips have already taken place" (from the English version).

Steve Redhead wrote a book-length criticism of Virilio's work up to 2004, observing:

"His scattergun writing style is not always easy to follow, often provoking disorientation and dislocation at the very least. Insights, personal memories, detailed histories, major theoretical leaps and banalities sit side by side."

Redhead also notes that Virilio's work "leaves the reader with the feeling of many dislocated, undeveloped ideas swirling around often at the level of great generality" and that "the content is often not particularly logical if viewed from a conventional academic perspective." However, he concedes Virilio's importance for law and popular culture studies.

Mark Lacy noted in 2014 that "Virilio is unlikely to be read in the 'mainstream' of academia (although one might find his works on the reading lists of a military academy)." Lacy credits Virilio with balancing the propaganda of progress against the management of fear:

"Virilio's often alien-sounding concepts attempt to enable us to see the world anew, to view a world that is presented to us in terms of fear and progress as something alien (and alienating), to give a form to feelings and suspicions that remain vague, unclear, uncertain, out of place."

Other critics have pointed to Virilio's sometimes confusing style, particularly "the annoying strategy of emphasizing certain words, especially improbable neologisms, by writing them in CAPITAL LETTERS" (from the French version).

Some have noted that Virilio sometimes seems caught in his own trap: "His innumerable works reflect the same experience of over-speed that they criticize, offering fragmented images, snapshots of the state of the world at a given moment, facts, stories that overwhelm the reader. He offers neither analysis nor commentary, and theorizes only their combination and juxtaposition."

Despite these criticisms, his visionary qualities are widely recognized:

"Once the scientific-prospective pretensions are set aside, a very lively thought appears that stands at odds with the communicational myth of bringing people together through new technologies."

"Many themes that have today become evident in political reflection and militant action were approached and explored by Virilio at a time when almost no one was interested in them."

### Sokal and Bricmont Criticism

Virilio was one of the many cultural theorists and postmodernists criticized by physicists [Alan Sokal](/article/en/Alan_Sokal) and [Jean Bricmont](/article/en/Jean_Bricmont) in their 1997 book "Fashionable Nonsense" (also known as "Intellectual Impostures"). They devoted chapter 10 to Virilio's works, characterizing them as misunderstanding and misusing science and mathematics.

Their criticism consists of a series of quotes from Virilio's works, followed by explanations of how Virilio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology. In their words:

"The writings of Paul Virilio revolve principally around the themes of technology, communication, and speed. They contain a plethora of references to physics, particularly the theory of relativity. Though Virilio's sentences are slightly more meaningful than those of Deleuze-Guattari, what is presented as 'science' is a mixture of monumental confusions and wild fantasies. Furthermore, his analogies between physics and social questions are the most arbitrary imaginable, when he does not simply become intoxicated with his own words. We confess our sympathy with many of Virilio's political and social views; but the cause is not, alas, helped by his pseudo-physics."

An example of their criticism involves Virilio's confusion of velocity and acceleration: "Here Virilio mixes up velocity (vitesse) and acceleration, the two basic concepts of kinematics (the description of motion), which are introduced and carefully distinguished at the beginning of every introductory physics course. Perhaps this confusion isn't worth stressing; but for a purported specialist in the philosophy of speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising."

Other critics are more moderate: "If intellectual imposture is not far away, one can nevertheless salute the 'call to creative resistance' of this properly passionate dialogue. Whatever the objective reality of scientific statements, one is easily seduced by the linguistic alchemy of a Virilio who is by turns a thinker of speed, an urbanist haunted by his memories of the Second World War, a post-modern critic, and a citizen of the world."
