# Tanger Med

**Tanger Med** (Arabic: طنجة المتوسط, *Tanja al-Mutawassit*) is a Moroccan industrial and commercial port complex located in northern [Morocco](/article/en/Morocco), approximately 40–45 km northeast of [Tangier](/article/en/Tangier) on the [Strait of Gibraltar](/article/en/Strait_of_Gibraltar). Situated 14–15 km from the Spanish coast (opposite [Tarifa](/article/en/Tarifa,_Spain)), the port occupies a strategic position on major global maritime trade routes connecting [Asia](/article/en/Asia), [Europe](/article/en/Europe), and [North America](/article/en/North_America). As the largest port in [Africa](/article/en/Africa) and the [Mediterranean Sea](/article/en/Mediterranean_Sea), Tanger Med serves as a major transshipment hub and is ranked 19th globally among container ports.

## Overview

Tanger Med is one of the largest industrial ports in the world, with a total container handling capacity of 11 million [Twenty-foot Equivalent Units](/article/en/Twenty-foot_equivalent_unit) (TEU). The port complex is designed to handle 7 million passengers annually, process 700,000 TIR trucks, export 1 million vehicles, and manage 15 million tons of hydrocarbons. The port is surrounded by a free trade zone hosting more than 1,300 companies representing an annual export business volume of approximately €14 billion as of 2023, operating across diverse sectors including [automotive](/article/en/Automotive_industry), [aerospace](/article/en/Aerospace), food processing, logistics, and textiles.

The project constitutes a strategic priority of the Moroccan government for economic and social development in northern Morocco, oriented toward leveraging the nation's [free trade agreement](/article/en/Free_trade_agreement) with the [European Union](/article/en/European_Union). The particular geographic position at the crossing of two major maritime routes and the port's proximity to the EU market provide access to hundreds of millions of consumers.

## History

### Early Development (2003–2007)

The Tanger Med project was initiated in 2003 through the creation of the Agence Spéciale Tanger Méditerranée (TMSA, later known as the Tanger Mediterranean Special Agency), a public limited company tasked with implementing, coordinating, and managing the port complex. Construction commenced in 2004 and progressed for approximately three years before the inaugural phase became operational.

The first container terminal was officially inaugurated on July 27, 2007, by [Moroccan](/article/en/Morocco) King [Mohammed VI](/article/en/Mohammed_VI) following five years of construction and an investment of approximately two billion euros. The project's initial phase was constructed by a consortium including Møller-[Mærsk](/article/en/Mærsk), [Eurogate](/article/en/Eurogate), [Bouygues](/article/en/Bouygues), and Horizon Terminals.

### Expansion and Growth (2008–Present)

Early performance exceeded projections: the port handled one million containers in 2008 and 1.22 million in 2009. In October 2008, a draft loan contract of $180 million was signed to fund expansion works for a second deepwater port facility, designated "Tanger Med II," to accommodate growing international container handling demand. Final official approval for Tanger Med II was received on January 7, 2009, with construction commencing on June 17, 2009. In November 2010, the [European Investment Bank](/article/en/European_Investment_Bank) (EIB) provided a €200 million loan to support the port's extension.

Tanger Med II comprises two new container terminals (Terminals 3 and 4) with a combined additional capacity of 5 million containers. Terminal 3, with a capacity of 1 million TEU, began operations in January 2021, while Terminal 4, with a capacity of 5 million TEU, commenced operations in June 2019. These expansions elevated the total port capacity to 9–11 million containers.

Cargo handling volumes demonstrated significant growth: the port processed 42.0 million tons in 2015, 65 million tons in 2019, 75 million tons in 2020, and 101 million tons in 2021. By 2024, approximately 162 million tons were being handled annually, with 9.6 million TEU containers processed in 2023. On January 4, 2024, Tanger Med ranked first in Africa according to a Business Insider Africa report.

## Geography and Location

Tanger Med is situated at the locality of Oued Rmel in northern Morocco, where no significant port previously existed. The site was selected for its proximity to the [Iberian Peninsula](/article/en/Iberian_Peninsula), with the port of Tarifa being the nearest reference point at 15 km distance. The port's location within the [Strait of Gibraltar](/article/en/Strait_of_Gibraltar)—the world's second-busiest maritime route with approximately 100,000 vessel transits annually—provides strategic access to primary global shipping corridors. Goods reaching the port can reach [Marseille](/article/en/Marseille) or [Barcelona](/article/en/Barcelona) within 24 hours, or [Shanghai](/article/en/Shanghai) within 22 days. The port maintains connectivity with more than 180 ports across 70 countries.

On the northeastern end of the port, adjacent to Montaña Kasbah, a large illuminated Arabic inscription welcomes sailors traveling eastbound through the Strait. The inscription reads "Allāh, Al-Waṭan, Al-Malīk" ("Allah, the Homeland, the King"), reflecting Morocco's national motto. The monument is visible from approximately 15 km away from Tarifa and can be located on satellite imagery at coordinates 35°53′58″N 5°28′57″W.

## Rankings and Recognition

### International Port Rankings

Tanger Med ranks **19th worldwide** among 500 container ports according to rankings published by Alphaliner in March 2024. The port is the leading port in Africa for the 7th consecutive year and the leading port in the Mediterranean for the 4th consecutive year. With 8.6 million TEU handled in 2023, Tanger Med surpassed prestigious ports including the [Port of New York](/article/en/Port_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey) (ranked 21st globally) and the [Port of Hamburg](/article/en/Port_of_Hamburg) (ranked 22nd). Among [European ports](/article/en/Ports_of_Europe), Tanger Med is surpassed only by the [Port of Rotterdam](/article/en/Port_of_Rotterdam) and the [Port of Antwerp-Bruges](/article/en/Port_of_Antwerp). Notably, Tanger Med is the only Mediterranean port to appear in the global top 30. In 2023, the port achieved the 2nd-best annual percentage performance within the global top 20, with a 13.4% increase, second only to [Qingdao](/article/en/Qingdao) (+16.9%).

### Economic Zone Recognition

FDI Intelligence of the [Financial Times](/article/en/Financial_Times) ranked Tanger Med Zones as the **2nd global economic zone** in its 2020 "FDI's Global Free Zone of the Year" rankings, following the "Dubai Multi Commodities Center" in the [United Arab Emirates](/article/en/United_Arab_Emirates). This represented an improvement from its 5th-place ranking in 2019.

## Automotive Ecosystem

Tanger Med has developed as a major automotive manufacturing and export hub. The [Renault](/article/en/Renault) TangerMed plant represents the largest automobile manufacturing facility in Africa. The port serves as the primary export gateway for vehicles produced at the Renault Mellousa factory and supports operations for major automotive suppliers including Nissan, Fiat, Delphi, Sogefi, Denso, Magnetti Marelli, Yazaki, and Valeo, creating an integrated automotive ecosystem.

## Strategic Significance

### Geographic Advantage

Tanger Med's position at the intersection of the [Atlantic Ocean](/article/en/Atlantic_Ocean) and [Mediterranean Sea](/article/en/Mediterranean_Sea) and on the [Strait of Gibraltar](/article/en/Strait_of_Gibraltar) provides strategic advantages for transshipment operations. The port serves as a major hub for container transshipment and is the leading facility for cereal transshipment in the northwestern African region—a function previously non-existent in the area.

### European Integration

The port's proximity to the [European Union](/article/en/European_Union) (15 km from Spanish territory) positions it to serve as a gateway for Morocco's exports and a distribution hub for European goods entering North African markets. This strategic position supports Morocco's orientation toward export-based economic development and the implementation of its free trade agreement with the EU.

### Container Transshipment

Tanger Med has captured a significant portion of the growing container transshipment market, competing directly with the [Port of Algeciras](/article/en/Port_of_Algeciras) for traffic between Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf toward North America.

## Geopolitical Context

In 2022, [The New York Times](/article/en/The_New_York_Times) reported that [Russia](/article/en/Russia) has utilized Tanger Med to circumvent trade restrictions imposed following the invasion of [Ukraine](/article/en/Invasion_of_Ukraine_(2022)). This development illustrates the port's role in global supply chains and its strategic importance beyond regional commerce.

## Related Infrastructure

Tanger Med integrates with broader transportation networks through:

- **Highway connections** linking the port to major Moroccan cities and European routes
- **Railway connections** serving container, vehicle, and passenger transport
- **Multimodal terminal facilities** enabling seamless cargo transfer between maritime, rail, and road modes

## Competition

The primary regional competitor is the [Port of Algeciras](/article/en/Port_of_Algeciras) in Spain, located on the opposite side of the [Strait of Gibraltar](/article/en/Strait_of_Gibraltar). Both ports compete for cargo handling between Europe and North Africa and the Mediterranean region as well as traffic to states along the Persian Gulf directed toward [North America](/article/en/North_America).
