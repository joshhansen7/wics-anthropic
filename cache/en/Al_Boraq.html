# Al Boraq

Al Boraq (Arabic: البُراق, romanized: al-burāq) is a 323-kilometer (201 mi) high-speed rail service between Casablanca and Tangier in Morocco operated by [ONCF](/article/en/ONCF) (Office National des Chemins de Fer), Morocco's national railway company. The first of its kind on the [African continent](/article/en/Africa), it was inaugurated on November 15, 2018, after more than a decade of planning and construction. It is the first phase of Morocco's planned 1,500-kilometre (900 mi) high-speed rail network.

On the 186 km (116 mi) section from Tangier to Kenitra, Al Boraq trains run on a dedicated high-speed line at speeds up to 320 km/h (199 mph). For the final 137 km (85 mi), trains run on an upgraded mainline from Kenitra through Rabat and Morocco's most populous corridor to Casablanca at speeds up to 160 km/h (99 mph).

Since its launch, Al Boraq has significantly impacted rail transport in Morocco, offering reduced travel times, improved comfort, and a modern travel experience. According to ONCF statistics, the service transported 3 million passengers by the end of 2019, and this number increased to 5.6 million by 2025, generating revenue of nearly 3 billion dirhams.

## Name and Logo

King Mohammed VI of Morocco named the service "Al Boraq" (البُراق) after the creature in [Islamic tradition](/article/en/Islamic_mythology) believed to have transported some prophets, including the [Prophet Muhammad](/article/en/Muhammad) from Mecca to Jerusalem during the [Night Journey](/article/en/Isra_and_Mi'raj) (Isra and Mi'raj).

The brand logo was designed by Rachid Bouderka, a 22-year-old student at [Ibn Zohr University](/article/en/Ibn_Zohr_University) in Agadir, who won a competition launched in July 2018 and closed in November of the same year, accompanied by a prize of 30,000 dirhams. The logo figuratively represents an Al Boraq train in profile. The two colors of the train, green and red, are those of the [Moroccan flag](/article/en/Flag_of_Morocco), and it is decorated with star-patterned filigree inspired by the typical [zellige](/article/en/Zellige) patterns of Moroccan decorative art. The brand name is inscribed in the lower part of the logo, in both Latin alphabet and Arabic.

## History

### Early Planning and Financing

Early studies into the feasibility of high-speed rail in Morocco began in 2003, and by 2006, the route between Tangier and Kenitra had been identified as being among the first lines to be constructed. The project was announced during an official visit by French President [Nicolas Sarkozy](/article/en/Nicolas_Sarkozy) to Morocco in 2007, where it was announced that the French company [Alstom](/article/en/Alstom) would participate in this project. The same year, ONCF announced plans to purchase 18 Alstom trainsets. In 2008, ONCF said that it planned to begin construction that year, with operations to begin in 2013.

Financing was not finalized until February 2010, when ONCF signed agreements worth 20 billion dirhams (DH). Direct investments came from the Moroccan government, which allocated DH4.8 billion to the project, and European sources, which invested a total of DH1.9 billion, while the remaining DH12.3 billion came from commercial loans. DH10 billion were to be spent on infrastructure, with DH5.6 billion going to supporting equipment and DH4.4 billion to rolling stock. At the time, work was expected to start in mid-2010, with service beginning in December 2015. 

In December 2010, ONCF signed a final agreement to purchase 14 Alstom Euroduplex trainsets.

### Construction and Testing

Following further delays, construction of the line began on September 29, 2011, when a groundbreaking ceremony took place in Tangier, presided over by King Mohammed VI and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

On September 25, 2012, work began on a project to increase capacity on the trackage between Kenitra and Casablanca by constructing a dedicated freight track in the existing right of way, allowing for passenger trains to access Casablanca from the high-speed line to Tangier. 

In addition to the rail construction, stations in four locations (Tangier-Ville, Kenitra, Rabat-Agdal, and Casa-Voyageurs) were either constructed from the ground up or rebuilt from existing facilities.

On June 19, 2015, rolling stock deliveries began with the arrival of the first trainset in Tangier. That same year, King Mohammed VI, accompanied by French President [François Hollande](/article/en/François_Hollande), inaugurated the high-speed train maintenance workshop in the Mghougha district in Tangier. This workshop spans an area of 14 hectares, with 20,000 square meters dedicated to buildings, and forms an important link in the high-speed rail project. Its location, two kilometers from the Tangier City train station, facilitates the movement of trains between the station and the workshop.

In September 2015, the service facility for the trains in Tangier was completed, and a joint venture between ONCF and French rail operator [SNCF](/article/en/SNCF) was established to maintain the trains for a 15-year contract.

In February 2017, testing of the trains at revenue speeds began; during the test program, an African rail speed record of 357 kilometres per hour (222 mph) was set. The train was tested in the presence of then-French Foreign Minister [Jean-Yves Le Drian](/article/en/Jean-Yves_Le_Drian).

In October 2017, track construction was completed, followed by installation of the new electric catenary that November. The electrical system was energized for the first time in January 2018, and the line's control facility came online the following month. By mid-2018, the stations had been completed, though the expected entry into service was pushed back to the end of the year, as trial runs over the route had yet to be operated.

### Inauguration and Service Launch

On November 15, 2018, the Al Boraq service was inaugurated at a Tangier ceremony by King Mohammed VI and French President [Emmanuel Macron](/article/en/Emmanuel_Macron) on a special train that traveled to Rabat. Commercial service began before the end of the year. By December 25, 2018, trains were scheduled to depart Casablanca every two hours from 06:00 until 21:00 (6:00 AM to 9:00 PM). On weekends, service begins at 7:00 AM.

The inauguration of the high-speed rail service also came with the opening of several new or renovated train stations: Tanger-Ville Railway Terminal, Kenitra Station, Rabat-Agdal Station, and Casa-Voyageurs Railway Station.

### Future Expansion Plans

In January 2022, Mohamed Abdeljalil, Morocco's Minister of Transport and Logistics, announced that the Al Boraq network would eventually terminate in [Agadir](/article/en/Agadir) and announced the construction of a high-speed line which would connect Agadir with [Marrakesh](/article/en/Marrakesh).

In November 2022, Abdeljalil announced the construction of dedicated high-speed tracks that would connect Marrakesh to the original line via Kenitra. The construction is to take place in three segments:
1. The 150-kilometre-long (93 mi) segment connecting Kenitra with Aïn Sebaâ to be constructed first
2. A 130-kilometre-long (81 mi) extension from Aïn Sebaâ to Nouaceur
3. Finally, the construction of new tracks from Nouaceur to Marrakesh, with the cities 212 km (132 mi) apart

Tests were run on the current tracks from Casablanca to Marrakesh in January 2023, reaching 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). The plan is to continue to test the current tracks between Casablanca and Marrakesh, with ONCF hoping that a top speed of 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) can be reached safely.

After several memorandums signed by Morocco and the [United Arab Emirates](/article/en/United_Arab_Emirates) including the HSL, and Morocco's joint bid with [Spain](/article/en/Spain) and [Portugal](/article/en/Portugal) for the [2030 FIFA World Cup](/article/en/2030_FIFA_World_Cup), the HSL project connecting Kenitra to Marrakesh has gained significant momentum, with an opening planned for November 2029.

#### Marrakech - Agadir Line

During the commemorative speeches of the [Green March](/article/en/Green_March) in November 2015 and 2019, King Mohammed VI reiterated the strategic importance of the Marrakech - Agadir line and invited the government to accelerate the implementation of the HSL between the two cities in southern Morocco, which are also the country's tourism capitals.

In March 2020, a ministerial decree authorized the expropriation in the name of public utility of 4-hectare land plots located in Agadir municipality to build the future high-speed train railway station. In May of the same year, adjacent plots of 20 hectares were expropriated.

In April 2025, Morocco launched the construction of the high-speed rail line connecting the cities of Kenitra and Marrakech, which is 430 kilometers long with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, as part of a program to enhance the railway infrastructure with a budget of nearly $10 billion.

## Infrastructure

The line is made up of two sections—a new route from Tangier to Kenitra and an upgrade of the existing route from Kenitra to Casablanca. The 186-kilometre-long (116 mi) Tangier–Kenitra line has a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph), while the 137-kilometre-long (85 mi) Kenitra–Casablanca line was rated for 160 km/h (99 mph) when service began, with a planned upgrade to 220 km/h (137 mph).

The trackage from Kenitra to Casablanca is to be eventually replaced by a new high-speed right of way, with construction scheduled to begin in 2020. Two electrification types are used—from Tangier to Kenitra, the new trackage was built with 25 kV 50 Hz AC electrification while the line from Kenitra to Casablanca retained the existing 3,000 V DC catenary. The [ETCS](/article/en/European_Train_Control_System)-type signal system was installed by [Ansaldo STS](/article/en/Ansaldo_STS) and [Cofely Ineo](/article/en/Cofely_Ineo).

At service launch in 2018, travel time between Casablanca and Tangier dropped from 4 hours and 45 minutes to 2 hours and 10 minutes. Completion of dedicated high-speed trackage to Casablanca would further reduce travel time to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

## Rolling Stock

The twelve (14 were originally ordered) [Alstom Euroduplex](/article/en/Euroduplex) trainsets operating on the line are bilevel and have a passenger capacity of 533. Each trainset is composed of two power cars and eight passenger cars (two first-class cars, five second-class cars, and a buffet car).

The trains, which correspond to the latest Océane trains for the Paris-Bordeaux route, are multi-current capable (25 kV and 3 kV), as they switch from the high-speed line to the conventional line between Kenitra and Casablanca. In principle, the trains could therefore also operate in the wider Moroccan railway network.

Furthermore, the trains are specially adapted to Moroccan weather conditions. They are equipped with reinforced air conditioning systems as well as sand and dust filters. All trains are equipped with the latest technologies for passenger comfort and have a special section that allows passengers with special needs to easily access the train. These trains also have digital information systems in both Arabic and French to inform passengers about the train's speed and the stations it passes through.

Second-class compartments are equipped with two seats on each side, while first-class compartments have two seats on one side and only one seat on the other side, providing greater comfort for first-class travelers. All seats in both first and second class have places to charge electronic devices (such as phones and computers).

In March 2025, 18 [Avelia Horizon](/article/en/Avelia_Horizon) trains were ordered from Alstom at a value of €781 million.
