# Baguette

A baguette ([baɡɛt], French pronunciation: [baɡɛt]) is a long, thin type of bread of French origin that is commonly made from basic lean dough. It is distinguishable by its length, crisp crust, and elongated shape. The baguette has become one of the most recognizable symbols of France and French culture worldwide, particularly associated with Paris.

In November 2018, documentation surrounding the "craftsmanship and culture" of making this bread was added to the [French Ministry of Culture](/article/en/French_Ministry_of_Culture)'s National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2022, the artisanal know-how and culture of baguette bread was inscribed to the [UNESCO](/article/en/UNESCO) [Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists](/article/en/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage).

## Characteristics

A standard baguette typically has a diameter of about 5 to 6 centimeters (2–2½ inches) and a height of about 3 to 5 centimeters. Its usual length is about 65 centimeters (26 inches), but can be up to 1 meter (39 inches) long. A traditional baguette weighs approximately 250 grams (8¾ ounces).

The baguette is characterized by its crisp crust and soft, white interior crumb. The crumb regains its shape when pressed, this shape recovery being related to its elasticity. The higher the protein percentage of the flour, the more elastic the bread. The crust's darkness and crispness depend on the baking temperature. The diagonal cuts (scarification) on the surface of the baguette, known as "grigne" in French, allow the bread to expand properly during baking.

## Types and Variants

Different variants of the baguette are characterized by their dimensions and names:

- **Flûte** or **Parisian bread**: Thicker than a standard baguette, with a mass of about 400 grams.
- **Ficelle**: Thinner than a baguette, weighing up to 125 grams. The name means "string" in French.
- **Half-baguette** or **déjeunette**: A shorter version of the baguette.
- **Bâtard**: A short, almost rugby ball-shaped loaf. In the UK, it's sometimes referred to using the English translation "bastard loaf."
- **Boule**: Literally "ball" in French, a large round loaf.
- **Miche**: A large pan loaf.

The Arabic Wikipedia mentions a variant called **Samoli** or **Samoon bread**, which is stuffed with eggs, jam, cheese, or similar fillings, and usually sprinkled with sesame, bran, or wheat on top. This variant is popular in several Arab countries and possibly originated from a Somali baker in Saudi Arabia or may have Italian or Turkish origins.

## Composition and Legal Definition

According to the French decree 93-1074 of September 13, 1993, the "baguette de tradition française" (traditional French baguette) must be made only from the following ingredients:
- Wheat flour
- Water
- Yeast or sourdough
- Common salt

The decree allows for a few specific additives:
- Up to 2% broad bean flour
- Up to 0.5% soya flour
- Up to 0.3% wheat malt flour

By contrast, the ordinary baguette or common bread (baguette ordinaire) sold in bakeries and supermarkets may contain up to 14 food additives, including:
- Acetic acid and its salts (E260, E261, E262, E263)
- Lactic acid and its salts (E270, E325, E326, E327)
- Ascorbic acid, its salts and esters (E300, E301, E302, E304)
- Lecithin (E322)
- Mono and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471)

This means that ordinary baguettes may not be suitable for vegans due to the possible presence of animal-derived additives, as noted in the Arabic Wikipedia.

## History

Much of the history of the baguette is speculative, but some facts can be established. Long, stick-like breads in France became more popular during the 18th century. The shape of these fancy breads, sometimes nearly two meters long, already surprised visitors to France in the 19th century.

Several key developments contributed to what we now recognize as the modern baguette:

1. At the beginning of the 19th century, French bakers started using "gruau" or "semolina," a highly refined Hungarian high-milled flour.

2. Viennese steam oven baking was introduced to Paris in 1839 by [August Zang](/article/en/August_Zang), who also introduced Vienna bread (pain viennois) and the [croissant](/article/en/Croissant).

3. At the 1867 [Universal Exhibition](/article/en/Universal_Exhibition), [Adolf Ignaz Mautner von Markhof](/article/en/Adolf_Ignaz_Mautner_von_Markhof) introduced Austrian compact yeast to Paris.

4. The word "baguette" (in the sense of a fancy bread) appears in a patent from 1902 where the manufacture of baguettes is presented.

5. The term "semolina baguette" is mentioned in a diet prescription in 1910.

6. The baguette was officially defined in a regulation of the department of the Seine in August 1920: "The baguette, having a minimum weight of 80 g and a maximum length of 40 cm, may not be sold for a price higher than 0.35 francs apiece."

While no single event constitutes "the invention of the baguette," together these developments define what we now recognize as the modern baguette. As bread historian [Steven Kaplan](/article/en/Steven_Kaplan) notes, "It's neither August Zang, nor Napoleon, the baguette is a product of the 20th century. It's an evolution of urban demand. Wealthy people in cities needed fresh bread several times a day. The large bread that weighed between 1.2 and 2 kilos was simply too big. And they liked the crust more than the crumb."

Following the World Wars, French bakers began baking a whiter, softer baguette that contrasted with the darker loaves produced because of rationing during the wars. These doughs took less time to ferment and used more additives but had significantly less taste.

## Origin Myths

Because the history of the French baguette is not completely documented, several myths have spread about its origins:

1. **Napoleon's Military Theory**: Some say [Napoleon Bonaparte](/article/en/Napoleon_Bonaparte) created the French baguette to allow soldiers to more easily carry bread. Since round breads took up a lot of space, Bonaparte allegedly requested they be made into a skinny stick shape to slide into the soldiers' uniforms.

2. **Metro Workers Theory**: Another story credits baguettes as being an invention to stop [Paris Metro](/article/en/Paris_Metro) workers from carrying knives to cut their bread. The workers often fought, so management allegedly requested bread that could be easily torn apart by hand, eliminating the need for knives. Engineer [Fulgence Bienvenüe](/article/en/Fulgence_Bienvenüe), who supervised the construction of the metro, is sometimes mentioned in this version.

3. **The 1920 Law Theory**: Some believe the baguette developed in response to a law from 1919 (which some say took effect in October 1920) that prohibited bakers from working before 4 a.m. This made it impossible to make traditional round loaves in time for customers' breakfasts. The slender shape of the baguette could be prepared and baked more quickly, solving this problem.

4. **The "Bread of Equality" Theory**: Some believe baguettes were created following a decree post-[French Revolution](/article/en/French_Revolution) requiring a type of bread to be made accessible to both rich and poor.

While these stories are widely repeated, bread historians generally consider them to be legends rather than documented facts.

## Manufacturing Process

The French consume about 30 million baguettes each day, mostly produced by artisans. In 2011, in France, 59.8% of flour intended for bread-making was converted into bread by artisanal bakery-pastry shops (32,000 businesses), 32.1% by industrial bakery-pastry shops (270 businesses), 8.9% by bakery-pastry workshops in supermarkets, and only 0.1% by the public sector.

The manufacturing process of the baguette follows these steps:

1. **Autolysis** (optional): Flour and water are mixed and left to rest to activate enzymatic reactions.

2. **Mixing and Kneading**: Ingredients are mixed until a homogeneous dough is obtained, then kneaded to create links between the proteins of the flour.

3. **Fermentation** (Pointing): The dough ferments in bulk, allowing the creation of aromas from yeast and/or lactic acid bacteria activity. This phase can last several hours for traditional breads.

4. **Division and Pre-shaping**: The dough is divided into pieces of 300 to 400 g for baguettes and given an initial shape.

5. **Relaxation**: A rest phase of 5 to 30 minutes allows the dough to soften.

6. **Shaping**: The final forming of the dough piece, including rolling, folding, and elongation.

7. **Proofing**: The final fermentation phase, lasting from 20 minutes to several hours, allows the dough to expand.

8. **Scarification**: Light incisions are made on the surface at a 45° angle with a razor blade.

9. **Baking**: Baguettes are baked in an oven with steam injection for 20 to 30 minutes.

10. **Cooling**: The baguettes are placed on racks to let the water vapor escape without softening the crust.

Since the 1980s, millers have established baguette brands to promote and enhance their flour production. The first of these brands was launched by a group of millers (UNIMIE) under the name [Banette](/article/en/Banette).

In 2004, the bakery chain Marie Blachère introduced the option to select three varieties of baguettes distinguished by baking time: bien cuite (well done), dorée (golden) and blanche (white).

## Quality Recognition

In April 1944, a competition called Le Grand Prix de la Baguette began in France to determine who made the best baguettes. Nearly 200 bakers compete each year in front of a 14-judge panel following strict guidelines. They are judged based on baking, appearance, smell, taste, and crumb. The winner receives €4000 and supplies France's president with their daily bread for that year until a new winner is chosen.

Since 1994, the city of Paris awards the Grand prix de la baguette de tradition française de la ville de Paris for the best baguette in the city.

In 1993, the French Parliament passed Le Décret Pain (The Bread Decree). Le Décret Pain states that breads under the name of pain maison (homemade bread) must be "fully kneaded, shaped, and baked at their place of sale." This decree also placed strict guidelines on what pain traditionnel français (traditional French bread) is allowed to be made of, banning pre-made dough from being used for traditional French baguettes.

## Consumption

### Methods of Consumption

The baguette is consumed in various ways:

- As a sandwich base, particularly for "submarine" type sandwiches or panini
- Sliced and served with pâté or cheese
- As tartines, slices spread with butter and jam for breakfast, sometimes dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate
- As an accompaniment to meals
- Torn by hand and used to dip in sauces or soups

In France, the traditional way to eat a baguette is to tear it by hand rather than cut it with a knife, which some connect to the metro workers origin story.

### Consumption by Country

According to statistics established by the [FAO](/article/en/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization) in collaboration with the World Bakers Federation, the top consumers of baguettes in the world are:

1. **Algeria**: Approximately 49 million baguettes per day (as noted in the English Wikipedia) or 48.6 million baguettes daily (according to the French Wikipedia).

2. **France**: About 30 million baguettes consumed daily.

3. **Morocco and Tunisia**: Significant consumption, though less than Algeria and France.

The influence of the baguette can also be found in former French colonies and territories:

- In [Vietnam](/article/en/Vietnam), the baguette evolved into the [bánh mì](/article/en/Bánh_mì), which uses a high proportion of rice flour
- In [Cambodia](/article/en/Cambodia), it is found in the form of a hot sandwich called num pang (នំប៉័ង)
- In [Laos](/article/en/Laos), the khao jee pâté is a popular baguette-based dish

The average consumption of bread in France fell from 600 grams/day in the early 1900s to 170 grams/day in 1986, reflecting changing dietary habits.

## Cultural Significance

The baguette is one of the most recognizable symbols of France worldwide, alongside wine, the beret, and cheese. It has particular associations with Paris and is considered emblematic of French culture.

The Arabic Wikipedia notes that there have been political events related to bread in some countries, such as the 1985 Tunisia protests, in which hundreds of Tunisians died (called the "Bread Martyrs") when President [Habib Bourguiba](/article/en/Habib_Bourguiba) raised the price of bread.

On November 30, 2022, "the artisanal know-how and culture of the baguette bread" was inscribed on UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list, recognizing its cultural importance not just to France but to humanity as a whole.
