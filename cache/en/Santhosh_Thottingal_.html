# Malayalam Script

The Malayalam script (Malayalam: മലയാളലിപി, Malayāḷa lipi; IPA: [mələjaːɭə lipi]) is a [Brahmic script](/article/en/Brahmic_scripts) used primarily to write the [Malayalam language](/article/en/Malayalam_language), the principal language of the Indian state of [Kerala](/article/en/Kerala), spoken by approximately 45 million [Malayali people](/article/en/Malayali). It is one of the official scripts of the [Indian Republic](/article/en/India). The script is also used to write several minority languages such as [Paniya](/article/en/Paniya_language), [Betta Kurumba](/article/en/Betta_Kurumba), [Ravula](/article/en/Ravula_language), and sometimes [Konkani](/article/en/Konkani_language) and [Tulu](/article/en/Tulu_language).

## Classification and Features

Like many Indic scripts, Malayalam is an [alphasyllabary](/article/en/Abugida) (abugida), a writing system that is partially "alphabetic" and partially syllable-based. The Malayalam script resembles [Tulu script](/article/en/Tulu_script) and [Tigalari script](/article/en/Tigalari_script), used to write the Tulu language spoken in coastal [Karnataka](/article/en/Karnataka) (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts) and the northernmost Kasargod district of Kerala.

The modern Malayalam alphabet consists of:
- 15 vowel letters
- 42 consonant letters 
- Various other symbols

As with other Indian scripts, the sounds are organized according to phonetic principles:
1. Vowels
2. Consonants grouped by place of articulation (starting from the throat):
   - Gutturals
   - Palatals
   - Retroflexes (Cerebrals)
   - Dentals
   - Labials
3. Followed by:
   - Semivowels
   - Sibilants
   - Aspirate

Each group of five consonant signs is further subdivided into voiceless (unaspirated and aspirated), voiced (unaspirated and aspirated), and a nasal for each group.

Malayalam is unicase (does not have uppercase and lowercase distinctions) and is written from left to right. However, certain vowel signs are attached to the left of a consonant letter that they logically follow. For example, in the word കേരളം (Kēraḷam), the vowel sign േ (ē) visually appears in the leftmost position, though the vowel ē logically follows the consonant k.

## History

### Origins

The writing systems of Dravidian languages, including Malayalam, originated from the [Brahmi script](/article/en/Brahmi_script). Malayalam was first written in [Vatteluttu](/article/en/Vatteluttu) script (Malayalam: വട്ടെഴുത്ത്, Vaṭṭeḻuttŭ, lit. 'round writing'), an ancient script of Tamil and Malayalam languages that evolved from Tamil-Brahmi and was once used extensively in the southern part of present-day [Tamil Nadu](/article/en/Tamil_Nadu) and in Kerala.

The modern Malayalam script evolved through a complex process involving multiple influences:

1. **Vatteluttu**: The oldest script used for writing Malayalam, derived from [Tamil-Brahmi](/article/en/Tamil-Brahmi).

2. **Grantha**: According to [Arthur Coke Burnell](/article/en/Arthur_Coke_Burnell), one form of the [Grantha alphabet](/article/en/Grantha_alphabet), originally used in the [Chola dynasty](/article/en/Chola_dynasty), was imported into the southwest coast of India in the 8th or 9th century. It later evolved into Tigalari-Malayalam script, which split into two scripts: Tigalari (used solely for Sanskrit) and Malayalam.

3. **Tamil influence**: As Malayalam shares linguistic roots with [Tamil](/article/en/Tamil_language), the script development was also influenced by Tamil writing systems.

### Evolution

The [Vazhappally inscription](/article/en/Vazhappally_inscription) issued by Rajashekhara Varman around 830 CE is considered the earliest example of the Vatteluttu script used for Malayalam. During the medieval period, the Tigalari script used for writing Tulu in South Canara and Sanskrit in the adjacent Malabar region was very similar to the modern Malayalam script.

While the modern Tamil script had supplanted Vatteluttu in Tamil Nadu by the 15th century, Vatteluttu remained in general use in the Malabar region up to the 17th or 18th century. Variant forms included:
- **Kolezhuthu**: Used until about the 19th century, mainly in the Malabar-Cochin area
- **Malayanma**: Used in the south of Thiruvananthapuram

In the Malabar region, the Grantha-based writing system was termed Arya-eluttu (ആര്യ എഴുത്ത്, Ārya eḻuttŭ), meaning "Arya writing," reflecting its use for writing Sanskrit (an Indo-Aryan language) as opposed to Malayalam (a Dravidian language).

Vatteluttu was generally used for everyday purposes but was not suitable for literature where many Sanskrit words were used. Like Tamil-Brahmi, it was originally designed to write Tamil and lacked letters for voiced or aspirated consonants used in Sanskrit but not in Tamil. For this reason, Vatteluttu and the Grantha alphabet were sometimes mixed, as in the [Manipravalam](/article/en/Manipravalam) literary tradition. One of the oldest examples of Manipravalam literature, Vaishikatantram (വൈശികതന്ത്രം, Vaiśikatantram), dates back to the 12th century, where the earliest form of the Malayalam script was used.

### Modern Development

[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan](/article/en/Thunchaththu_Ezhuthachan), a poet from around the 16th century (sometimes cited as 17th century), is credited with developing Malayalam script into its current form through the intermixing and modification of Vatteluttu, Kolezhuthu, and Grantha script. He used Arya-eluttu to write his Malayalam poems based on Classical Sanskrit literature, and for a few letters missing in Arya-eluttu (ḷa, ḻa, ṟa), he used Vatteluttu. The popularity of his works led to him being called "the father of the Malayalam language" and helped popularize Arya-eluttu as the standard script for Malayalam.

The Malayalam script as it exists today was further modified in the middle of the 19th century when [Hermann Gundert](/article/en/Hermann_Gundert) invented new vowel signs to distinguish between e and ē, and between o and ō, which were not differentiated in the Grantha script used for Sanskrit.

By the 19th century, older scripts like Kolezhuthu had been completely supplanted by Arya-eluttu (the current Malayalam script), which became widely used in the Malayali press in Kerala.

## Orthography Reform

### The Reform Process

In 1961, the [Government of Kerala](/article/en/Government_of_Kerala) initiated reforms to the orthography of Malayalam through a government order to the education department. The objective was to simplify the script for print and typewriting technology of that time by reducing the number of glyphs required. In 1967, the government appointed a committee headed by [Sooranad Kunjan Pillai](/article/en/Sooranad_Kunjan_Pillai), who was the editor of the Malayalam Lexicon project. This committee's recommendations, which reduced the number of glyphs required for Malayalam printing from around 1000 to around 250, were further modified by another committee in 1969.

The reformed script proposal was accepted by major newspapers in January 1971 and officially came into effect on April 15, 1971 (the [Malayalam New Year](/article/en/Malayalam_calendar)), following a government order issued on March 23, 1971.

### Key Recommendations of the Reform

The reform introduced several major changes:

1. **Non-ligating vowel signs**: In the traditional orthography, consonants followed by the vowel signs u, ū, and r̥ were represented by cursive consonant-vowel ligatures, with each consonant having its unique way of ligating with these vowel signs. The reformed script simplified this by using disconnected vowel symbols that do not fuse with the base consonant.

2. **Split of uncommon conjuncts**: Most traditional consonant-consonant ligatures, especially the less common ones used primarily for Sanskrit loanwords, were split into non-ligated forms with explicit chandrakkala (virama).

3. **Non-ligating sign for conjoining ra**: Traditionally, any consonant followed by a conjoining ra was represented by a cursive tail attached to the consonant. In the reformed script, this was replaced by a disconnected left-bracket-like symbol placed on the left side of the cluster.

### Current Status

Today, the reformed orthography is commonly called "putiya lipi" (Malayalam: പുതിയ ലിപി, "new script") and the traditional system, "pazhaya lipi" (Malayalam: പഴയ ലിപി, "old script"). Current print media almost entirely uses reformed orthography, and the state-run primary education introduces the Malayalam writing to pupils using only the reformed script.

However, in digital media, both traditional and reformed scripts are used in almost equal proportions as fonts for both orthographies are commonly available. With the advent of Unicode and modern digital typography, some of the technical limitations that necessitated the reform have become less relevant.

## Description

### Basic Characters

The basic characters of Malayalam can be classified into:

1. **Vowels** (സ്വരം, svaram)
   - Independent vowel letters
   - Dependent vowel signs (സ്വരചിഹ്നം, svarachinnam)

2. **Consonants** (വ്യഞ്ജനം, vyañjanam)

An independent vowel letter is used as the first letter of a word that begins with a vowel. A consonant letter, despite its name, does not represent a pure consonant but represents a consonant + a short vowel /a/ by default. For example, ക is the first consonant letter of the Malayalam alphabet, which represents /ka/, not a simple /k/.

A vowel sign is a diacritic attached to a consonant letter to indicate that the consonant is followed by a vowel other than /a/. If the following vowel is /a/, no vowel sign is needed. The phoneme /a/ that follows a consonant by default is called an inherent vowel. In Malayalam, its phonetic value is unrounded [ɐ], or [ə] as an allophone.

### Virama and Chandrakkala

To denote a pure consonant sound not followed by a vowel, a special diacritic called virama (in Malayalam, chandrakkala ചന്ദ്രക്കല) is used to cancel the inherent vowel. The chandrakkala has two functions:

1. **As virama**: Used to suppress the inherent vowel
2. **As samvruthokaram**: To represent the "half-u" sound /ə̆/

At the end of a word, the chandrakkala sometimes represents a very short vowel, known as "half-u", or "samvruthokaram" (സംവൃതോകാരം, saṁvr̥tōkāram), or "kuṟṟiyal ukaram" (കുറ്റിയൽ ഉകരം). The exact pronunciation of this vowel varies from dialect to dialect but is approximately [ɯ̽] or [ɨ].

### Chillus

A chillu, or a chillaksharam (ചില്ലക്ഷരം, cillakṣaram), is a special consonant letter that represents a pure consonant independently, without the help of a virama. Unlike a consonant represented by an ordinary consonant letter, this consonant is never followed by an inherent vowel. Six independent chillu letters had been encoded in Unicode 5.1, and three additional chillu letters were encoded with the publication of Unicode 9.0.

### Ligatures

Like in other Indic scripts, a virama is used in the Malayalam script to cancel the inherent vowel of a consonant letter. When a dead consonant (a consonant with a virama) is followed by another consonant, they may form a ligature. These can be:

1. **Fully conjoined ligature**: Where both consonants form a new, combined glyph
2. **Half-conjoined**:
   - C1-conjoining: A modified form (half form) of the first consonant attached to the original form of the second
   - C2-conjoining: A modified form of the second consonant attached to the full form of the first
3. **Non-ligated**: Full forms of both consonants with a visible virama

Several consonant-consonant ligatures remain in common use even in the reformed orthography. Special cases include:

- **Consonant + ya, va**: These take post-base forms
- **Consonant + la**: Takes a below-base form
- **Consonant + ra**: Takes a pre-base form in the reformed orthography, while making a fully conjoined ligature in the traditional orthography

## Comparison with Tamil Script

Since Malayalam was written in Vatteluttu (the script also used for Tamil) for a certain period, Malayalam word formation shares similarities with Tamil word formation:

1. **Plosives**: In Malayalam, when writing Dravidian words, letters like ദ(da), ഗ(ga), ബ(ba), ഡ(Da) are not used. Instead, ത(ta), ക(ka), പ(pa), ട(Ta) are used to represent plosives, following similar rules to Tamil where க, த, ப, ட can be pronounced as plosives.

2. **Pronunciation of Sanskrit Words**: Sanskrit words written in Malayalam are pronounced according to Dravidian phonology. For example, though സ്വാഗതം (svāgatam) is written with 'g', it is pronounced as 'svāgadam'.

3. **Kuṟṟiyalukaram**: Like Tamil, Malayalam also has kuṟṟiyalukaram (shortened u-sound). In Malayalam, it's called 'samvruta ukaram' and is indicated by the chandrakkala.

4. **Sri Lankan Tamil Similarities**: Malayalam shares some letter usages similar to Sri Lankan Tamil. For example, റ്റ (ṟṟa) is pronounced as 't', and ന്‍റ (nṟa) is pronounced like 'nt' or 'nd'.

## Numeral System

Malayalam has its own numeral system, though it is now largely archaic and has been replaced by the common [Hindu-Arabic numeral system](/article/en/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system). The traditional Malayalam numerals are:

൦ (0), ൧ (1), ൨ (2), ൩ (3), ൪ (4), ൫ (5), ൬ (6), ൭ (7), ൮ (8), ൯ (9)

Additionally, there are symbols for 10 (൰), 100 (൱), and 1000 (൲).

In the traditional system, numbers are read differently. For example, "11" is written as "൰൧" (10+1) and not "൧൧". Similarly, "32" is written as "൩൰൨" (3×10+2), similar to the Tamil numeral system.

## Unicode

Malayalam script was added to the [Unicode](/article/en/Unicode) Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0. The Unicode block for Malayalam is U+0D00–U+0D7F.

### Chillus in Unicode

The representation of chillu letters in Unicode has evolved. Prior to Unicode 5.1, zero-width joiner (ZWJ) and zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ) were used to differentiate between a pure consonant (chillu) and a consonant with the samvruthokaram vowel. However, this system proved problematic since the distinction is often semantically significant, which contradicts the non-semantic nature of ZWJ/ZWNJ variation.

After considerable debate, nine chillu letters were given their own code points in Unicode 9.0, although only five of them are used in modern Malayalam. Applications should still be prepared to handle data in the representation specified in earlier Unicode versions, meaning fonts should display chillus correctly in both encoding sequences.
