# France

France (French: [fʁɑ̃s]), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a transcontinental country predominantly located in Western Europe. It has a rich history stretching from prehistoric times to the present day, with significant global influence in politics, economics, culture, and military affairs. The modern French state emerged from the union of various territories conquered by the Franks, a Germanic people, who gave their name to the country.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It shares borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Spain, and Andorra. Due to its overseas territories, France has land borders with Brazil and Suriname in South America and with the Netherlands in the Caribbean. With an exclusive economic zone of 11,035,000 km² (4,261,000 sq mi), France has the second-largest EEZ in the world.

France has long been a global center of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving around 90 million foreign visitors annually. France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by PPP. It is a founding and leading member of the European Union, the eurozone, and numerous international organizations.

## Etymology

The name "France" comes from Latin "Francia," meaning "land of the Franks." The Franks were a Germanic people whose name possibly derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as "javelin" or "lance," although these weapons may have been named after the Franks rather than the other way around. The name could also be connected to the word "frank" meaning "free," as after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation.

In Breton, France is called both "Bro-C'hall" (referring to the land where French is spoken, including Upper Brittany) and "Frañs," with the latter attested in Breton since the 15th century. The Breton word "gall" means "foreigner" and is unrelated to the Latin "Galia."

The French pronunciation of "France" is [fʁɑ̃s], while in English it is typically pronounced as /fræns/ in American English and /frɑːns/ or /fræns/ in British English.

## Geography

### Location and borders

Metropolitan France is located at the western extremity of Europe. It is bordered by the North Sea to the north, the English Channel to the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the southeast. It shares land borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the northeast, Germany and Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, and Spain and Andorra to the southwest. 

Metropolitan France covers 551,695 km² according to the IGN (543,940 km² according to INSEE), making it the largest country in the European Union and the third-largest in Europe after Russia and Ukraine. Due to its shape, it is often referred to as "the Hexagon" (l'Hexagone).

France's overseas territories extend its presence to South America (French Guiana), North America (Saint Pierre and Miquelon), the Caribbean (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthélemy, and Saint Martin), the Indian Ocean (Réunion, Mayotte, and the French Southern and Antarctic Territories), and the Pacific Ocean (New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and Clipperton Island). These territories give France the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world at 11 million km².

### Geology, topography and hydrography

Metropolitan France offers a great variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest. The Massif Central, Armorican Massif, Morvan, Vosges and Ardennes ranges were formed during the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, while the Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. Mont Blanc in the Alps is the highest point in Western Europe at 4,810.45 meters (15,782 ft) above sea level.

The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast.

France has an extensive river system consisting of four major rivers: the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, and the Rhône, along with their tributaries. Their combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders.

France has 11,000,000 km² (4,200,000 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas. The overseas territories feature diverse topographies, including volcanic islands, atolls, and the Amazon rainforest in French Guiana.

### Climate

The climate in metropolitan France is strongly influenced by the Azores High and the Gulf Stream. Several climate types can be distinguished:

- Strict oceanic climate in the west, extending from Flanders to the Basque Country
- Southwestern oceanic climate, which is warmer
- Degraded oceanic climate in the Paris Basin
- Semi-continental climate in the northeast and center-east
- Mediterranean climate along the southern coastline and in Corsica
- Mountain climate in the Alps, Pyrenees, Massif Central, Vosges, Jura, and Corsican mountains

Climate change is significantly affecting France. On June 28, 2019, Vérargues recorded 46°C (114.8°F), setting a new all-time temperature record. According to climate scientists, such heatwaves are now ten times more likely to occur than they would have a century ago.

The overseas territories experience various climates, from equatorial in French Guiana to subarctic in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and from tropical in the Caribbean and Pacific islands to polar in the French Southern and Antarctic Territories.

### Environment

France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971. According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world. France's carbon dioxide emissions per capita are lower than those of China and the United States, largely due to its heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis.

Forests account for 31% of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7% since 1990. French forests are among the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees. France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally.

There are nine national parks and 54 regional nature parks in France. A regional nature park (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development.

France faces several environmental challenges, including ecological fragmentation, coastal artificialization, pollution of water and soils, and plastic waste. In 2019, 22% of surface waters were of poor or very poor quality. The country's ecological footprint per inhabitant is 4.9 global hectares (gha), while its biocapacity per inhabitant is only 3 gha, creating an ecological deficit.

## History

### Prehistory and antiquity (before 5th century)

Human presence on the territory of present-day France dates back to approximately 1.8 million years ago. During the Upper Paleolithic, France was home to significant cave paintings, including the famous Lascaux Cave (c. 18,000 BCE) and the older Chauvet Cave (c. 36,000 BCE). Around 10,000 BCE, at the end of the last ice age, the climate became milder; from around 7,000 BCE, Western Europe entered the Neolithic period, and its inhabitants became sedentary.

Around 600 BCE, Greeks from Phocaea founded Marseille, the oldest city in France. At the same time, Celtic peoples began entering the territory, fully occupying it between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. This region became known as Gaul (Latin: Gallia).

From 125 BCE, the Romans began conquering southern Gaul, creating the province of Gallia Narbonensis. Between 58 and 51 BCE, Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul in the Gallic Wars. After his victory over the Celtic chieftain Vercingetorix at Alesia in 52 BCE, Rome annexed the area. Gaul was divided by Emperor Augustus into provinces, four of which approximately correspond to modern metropolitan France: Narbonensis in the south, Aquitania in the southwest, Lugdunensis in the center and west, and Belgica in the north.

Gaul became an important part of the Roman Empire, adopting Roman technology, agriculture, and law. Large cities emerged, and the region experienced peace and prosperity for about two centuries. However, from the 3rd century, Roman Gaul faced a crisis as the fortified border (limes) protecting the Empire was crossed by barbarian invaders. In the 4th century, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity, leading to its spread throughout Gaul.

By the late 4th century, barbarian invasions resumed. On December 31, 406, the Vandals, Suevi, and Alans crossed the Rhine and traversed Gaul to Spain. In the mid-5th century, the Alamanni and Franks settled in northeastern Gaul, putting pressure on the remaining Roman authorities.

### Early Middle Ages (5th-10th century)

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Gaul was divided among various Germanic kingdoms. The Franks, led by Clovis I, established themselves as the dominant power after his conversion to Catholic Christianity in 496, which gained him the support of the Church. Clovis is considered the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Frankish kingdom until the mid-8th century.

The Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). In 732, Charles Martel, a Frankish leader, defeated an Umayyad invasion at the Battle of Tours. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians in 751, founding the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and Central Europe.

Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800, Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. After his death, the empire was kept united by his son Louis I. However, in 843, the Treaty of Verdun divided the empire among Louis's three sons into East Francia, Middle Francia, and West Francia. West Francia, roughly corresponding to modern France, became the precursor of the French state.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, West Francia was threatened by Viking invasions. This led to the decentralization of authority, with nobility's titles and lands becoming hereditary, and the king's power becoming more religious than secular. Feudalism was thus established in France. The Carolingian dynasty ruled until 987, when Hugh Capet was elected king, founding the Capetian dynasty.

### High and Late Middle Ages (10th-15th century)

The Capetian kings began the process of unifying France, expanding their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern France by the 15th century. From 1190, they began to be referred to as "kings of France" rather than "kings of the Franks."

The French nobility played a prominent role in the Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. The Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) was launched to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwest.

The 11th century saw the rise of the House of Plantagenet, which established an "empire" from England to the Pyrenees. Tensions between France and the Plantagenet territories would last a hundred years until Philip II of France conquered most of the continental Plantagenet lands between 1202 and 1214.

In 1328, Charles IV died without an heir, and the crown passed to Philip of Valois rather than Edward III of England, who also had a claim to the throne. This dispute led to the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). After initial English successes, France eventually prevailed, inspired in part by Joan of Arc. During this period, France was also struck by the Black Death, which killed approximately half of the 17 million population.

### Renaissance and Early Modern period (15th-18th century)

The French Renaissance in the 15th and 16th centuries saw cultural development and the standardization of French, which became the official language of France and Europe's aristocracy. France became the rival of the Habsburg Empire during the Italian Wars.

Religious tensions led to the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598) between Catholics and Huguenots (French Protestants). The conflict ended with the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which granted some religious freedom to Huguenots, though it was later revoked by Louis XIV in 1685.

Under Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister to Louis XIII, the state became more centralized, and the royal power was reinforced. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century under Louis XIV, the "Sun King," who built the Palace of Versailles and made France the leading European power. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, and literature.

The reigns of Louis XV (1715-1774) and Louis XVI (1774-1792) saw France lose many of its colonial possessions, particularly in North America after the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). However, the country supported the American Revolution against Great Britain, though this further strained its finances. Scientific advances and Enlightenment philosophy gained momentum, setting the stage for the French Revolution.

### Revolutionary and Napoleonic era (1789-1815)

The French Revolution began in 1789 amidst a financial crisis and social discontent. The Estates General was convened, but the Third Estate broke away to form the National Assembly. On July 14, 1789, Parisians stormed the Bastille, marking the beginning of the Revolution. The Assembly abolished feudalism and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which proclaimed liberty, equality, and fraternity as ideals.

France became a constitutional monarchy, but King Louis XVI's flight attempt in 1791 and subsequent treasonous actions led to his deposition and execution in 1793. The First Republic was proclaimed, and France faced war with most European powers. The Revolution entered its most radical phase with the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), during which about 16,000 people were executed.

Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in a coup in 1799, establishing the Consulate. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor. Through the Napoleonic Wars, he conquered most of continental Europe. His empire collapsed after the disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 and defeats at Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815).

### 19th century (1815-1914)

After Napoleon's defeat, the Bourbon monarchy was restored under Louis XVIII. His successor, Charles X, was overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830, which brought Louis-Philippe to the throne. His "July Monarchy" was in turn overthrown by the Revolution of 1848, establishing the Second Republic.

In 1852, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the republic's president and Napoleon's nephew, proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon III, establishing the Second Empire. His reign saw significant industrial development and the rebuilding of Paris under Baron Haussmann, but ended with defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871.

The Third Republic was proclaimed in 1870. It faced immediate challenges, including the Paris Commune uprising in 1871, which was violently suppressed. Under the Republic, France built a new colonial empire, second only to Britain's, and underwent significant industrialization. The period known as the Belle Époque (1880-1914) was characterized by economic prosperity, cultural innovation, and optimism.

Major republican reforms included the establishment of free, secular, and compulsory education (1881-1882), freedom of the press (1881), legalization of trade unions (1884), and the separation of Church and State (1905).

### World Wars and interwar period (1914-1945)

France was one of the main participants in World War I (1914-1918). The conflict was largely fought on French soil and resulted in 1.4 million French deaths. France emerged victorious alongside its allies but at a tremendous human and economic cost.

The interwar period saw France struggle with reconstruction and economic instability. The Great Depression hit France later than other countries but had lasting effects. Political tensions increased with the rise of fascist and communist movements. In 1936, the Popular Front government introduced important social reforms, including paid vacations and the 40-hour workweek.

When World War II began in 1939, France declared war on Nazi Germany but was quickly defeated in June 1940. The country was divided into occupied and unoccupied zones, with the latter administered by the collaborationist Vichy regime under Marshal Philippe Pétain. The Vichy government participated in the Holocaust, facilitating the deportation of about 75,000 Jews to death camps.

Meanwhile, General Charles de Gaulle established a government-in-exile in London known as Free France. The Resistance movement grew within France. Following the Allied landings in Normandy (June 6, 1944) and Provence (August 15, 1944), France was liberated, and a provisional government was established under de Gaulle.

### Post-war era (1945-present)

After the war, France underwent a period of reconstruction and modernization. The Fourth Republic was established in 1946 but proved unstable, particularly in dealing with the process of decolonization. France fought costly wars in Indochina (1946-1954) and Algeria (1954-1962) in attempts to maintain its colonial empire.

A crisis over Algeria led to the return of de Gaulle to power in 1958 and the establishment of the Fifth Republic with a stronger presidency. De Gaulle sought to assert France's independence in foreign policy, developing an independent nuclear deterrent and withdrawing from NATO's integrated military command in 1966 (France would rejoin in 2009).

The "Thirty Glorious Years" (Les Trente Glorieuses) from 1945 to 1975 saw strong economic growth, the modernization of the country's infrastructure, and the development of a welfare state. May 1968 brought student and worker protests that challenged the political and social order.

After de Gaulle's resignation in 1969, France continued its commitment to European integration. Presidents Georges Pompidou (1969-1974), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-1981), François Mitterrand (1981-1995), and Jacques Chirac (1995-2007) oversaw France's evolution into a post-industrial economy and its increasing integration into the European Union.

Since the turn of the century, France has faced challenges including terrorism, economic downturns, and social tensions. Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy (2007-2012), François Hollande (2012-2017), and Emmanuel Macron (elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2022) have implemented various reforms to address these issues. In 2020, like the rest of the world, France was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a major health crisis and economic recession.

France remains a significant global player, maintaining its position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, and a founding member of the European Union and NATO.

## Politics and administration

### Constitution and government

France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with strong democratic traditions. The current constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on September 28, 1958, and has been amended numerous times since.

The executive branch has two leaders: the President of the Republic, who is the head of state and is elected directly by universal suffrage for a five-year term (formerly seven years until 2002), and the Prime Minister, who is the head of government and is appointed by the President.

The President is the most powerful figure in French politics, with significant powers including the appointment of the Prime Minister, the authority to dissolve the National Assembly, the command of the armed forces, and the power to call referendums. The President also presides over the Council of Ministers (cabinet meetings) and plays a leading role in foreign policy.

The Prime Minister leads the government, which is responsible to parliament. The Prime Minister is responsible for domestic policy and manages the day-to-day affairs of government. In case of "cohabitation," when the President and Prime Minister are from opposing political parties, the Prime Minister's influence is increased.

The legislative branch consists of a bicameral Parliament comprising the National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) and the Senate (Sénat). The 577 deputies of the National Assembly are elected directly by the people for five-year terms using a two-round system. The 348 senators are elected indirectly by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats up for election every three years. The National Assembly has more power than the Senate and can overrule it in case of disagreement on legislation.

The French judicial system is divided between the judicial branch (dealing with civil and criminal law) and the administrative branch (dealing with appeals against executive decisions). The highest courts are the Court of Cassation for judicial matters and the Council of State for administrative matters. The Constitutional Council reviews the constitutionality of legislation.

According to the constitution's first article, "France is an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic." Since 2003, it has been added that "its organization is decentralized."

### Territorial divisions

France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 metropolitan regions (including Corsica) and 5 overseas regions. The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments, which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons. These cantons are then divided into 35,416 communes (as of January 1, 2020), which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. Three communes—Paris, Lyon, and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.

The regions, departments, and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, possessing local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946.

Since the 1980s, France has undergone a major process of decentralization, transferring significant powers from the central government to the territorial collectivities. This process has been carried out in three major acts of decentralization (1982-1983, 2002-2004, and after 2010), giving more autonomy and responsibilities to local governments.

### Overseas territories

In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic includes several overseas collectivities and territories.

The five overseas regions (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are integral parts of the French Republic and the European Union, and French laws apply automatically. These regions are also departments, making them both regions and departments.

The five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna) have varying degrees of autonomy. They are not part of the European Union (except for Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin), though their inhabitants are French citizens.

New Caledonia has a unique status as a sui generis collectivity, with greater autonomy and its own citizenship. The French Southern and Antarctic Territories and Clipperton Island, which have no permanent inhabitants, are administered directly by the French central government.

### Foreign relations

France is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a nuclear-weapon state. It is a leading member of the European Union and NATO, although it was outside NATO's integrated military command from 1966 to 2009.

The foreign policy of France since the end of the Second World War has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU. However, France maintains an independent foreign policy, particularly in relation to the United States, and emphasizes its status as a nuclear power.

France has extensive diplomatic relations and is described as "the best networked state in the world," being a member of numerous international organizations including the G7, World Trade Organization (WTO), the Pacific Community (SPC), and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).

France has the third-largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organizations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.

France maintains a "special relationship" with its former African colonies (Françafrique) and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in the region. However, this relationship has been criticized for perpetuating neo-colonial practices.

### Military

The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), the French Navy (Marine Nationale), the French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace), and the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas.

France is a recognized nuclear state since 1960. The French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition, France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads, deployed by the Air and Space Force and the Navy.

France has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world. It produces equipment such as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile, and the Leclerc tank. France is a major arms seller, with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices.

According to a 2023 study, France has the seventh strongest military in the world and was the fifth largest arms exporter. The country spent 2.1% of its GDP on defense in 2023, amounting to US$61.3 billion.

### Law

France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes. The basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code, which was largely based on royal law codified under King Louis XIV. In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society.

French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes civil law and criminal law, while public law includes administrative law and constitutional law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).

France does not recognize religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. It abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, "offences against public decency" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.

France generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBTQ rights. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal. In 2024, France became the first nation in the European Union to explicitly protect abortion in its constitution.

Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for laïcité (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle, which continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism.

### Political parties and elections

The French political system is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation and frequent changes in party names and alliances. Since the 2017 elections, there has been a significant reconfiguration of the political landscape.

The main political parties and movements currently include:

- La République En Marche (LREM, now Renaissance): Founded by Emmanuel Macron, it won the presidency and parliamentary majority in 2017. It is centrist, pro-European, and social-liberal.

- Les Républicains (LR): The main center-right party, formerly known as UMP and RPR, heir to the Gaullist tradition.

- Parti Socialiste (PS): The traditional center-left party, which governed under François Hollande (2012-2017) but has seen its support decline significantly.

- Rassemblement National (RN, formerly Front National): A far-right nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen, which has gained increased support in recent elections.

- La France Insoumise (LFI): A left-wing populist movement led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

- Europe Écologie Les Verts (EELV): The main Green party in France.

Elections in France are conducted using a two-round system for both presidential and legislative elections. For the presidential election, candidates who receive more than 50% of the vote in the first round are elected; if no candidate receives that majority, a runoff is held between the top two candidates. In legislative elections, candidates who receive an absolute majority of votes in the first round, representing at least 25% of registered voters, are elected; otherwise, a second round is held where any candidate who received at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round can run.

## Economy

France has a mixed economy that combines extensive private enterprise with substantial state enterprise and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power, and telecommunications. It has been gradually relaxing its control over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly corporatizing the state sector and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, as well as in the insurance, banking, and defense industries.

### Economic overview

France is the world's seventh largest economy by nominal GDP and the ninth largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). It has the third largest economy in Europe after Germany and the United Kingdom. In 2023, France's nominal GDP was 3.1 trillion US dollars according to the IMF.

The French economy is highly diversified. Services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP, while the industrial sector accounts for one-fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by manufacturing output, at 1.9% of the global total.

Agriculture accounts for less than 2% of GDP but remains an important sector, with France being the largest agricultural producer in the European Union. The country is a major producer of wheat, dairy products, beef, eggs, cereals, and sugar beet, as well as the second largest producer of wine in the world.

France's economy benefits from high productivity, a large and skilled labor force, and significant natural resources. However, it faces challenges including high unemployment (particularly among youth), a decline in global market share for its exports, and substantial public debt.

### International trade and investment

France is a major player in international trade, being the fifth-largest trading nation in the world and the second-largest in Europe as of 2018. Exports represent over a fifth of GDP. Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labor.

France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe, despite maintaining protectionist policies in certain industries, particularly agriculture. In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources. According to the Bank of France, the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance, and insurance.

The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in mainland Europe. The Paris stock exchange, now part of Euronext, is one of the oldest in the world, created in 1724, and Europe's second-largest stock exchange market.

France's main trading partners are other European Union countries, the United States, and China. In 2016, Germany was both the largest importer of French goods (16.1% of exports) and the largest exporter to France (19.6% of imports).

### Government role in the economy

Under the doctrine of Dirigisme, the government historically played a major role in the economy. Policies such as indicative planning and nationalization are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as Trente Glorieuses. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market.

Since the late 20th century, France has loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned. State ownership now dominates only transportation, defense, and broadcasting. Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatization have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index, and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report.

Nonetheless, public expenditure accounts for a high proportion of GDP (56.8% in 2015, the second highest in the OECD), and compulsory levies represent 46.2% of GDP (2017), the highest rate among OECD member countries. Despite this high level of taxation, public finances have been strained, with France running budget deficits every year since 1974. Public debt stood at 98.4% of GDP at the end of 2018.

### Employment and labor

The French labor market is characterized by strong protections for workers, including a 35-hour workweek, extensive collective bargaining rights, and generous social benefits. However, it also suffers from structural unemployment, which has been persistently high compared to other developed economies.

As of August 2019, the unemployment rate stood at 8.5%, its lowest level since 2009. Youth unemployment is particularly high, at 23.6% in 2017. The long-term unemployment rate was 3.2% in the second quarter of 2019.

In 2017, 29.3 million people aged 15 to 64 in France were active in the labor market, representing 71.5% of this age group. Among them, 26.5 million had a job and 2.8 million were unemployed. The employment rate was 64.7%.

The service sector dominates employment, with 76.1% of the employed population working in this sector in 2018, compared to 13.3% in industry, 6.7% in construction, and 2.5% in agriculture.

In 2017, 88.4% of employed persons in France were employees, with 84.6% on permanent contracts or as civil servants, 10.8% on fixed-term contracts, 3.0% in temporary work, and 1.6% in apprenticeship. Intermediate professions and executives represented 43.7% of employed persons, workers 20.8%, and employees 27.2%.

### Key sectors

#### Agriculture and agri-food

Despite a decline in agricultural employment, France remains the leading agricultural producer in the European Union, representing 17% of the EU's total production in 2016. French agricultural production amounted to 78.8 billion euros in 2017, or 3.5% of French GDP, compared to about 7% in 1980.

France is the leading European producer of beef, eggs, cereals, and sugar beet. It is the sixth largest producer of butter in the world and the leading exporter of potatoes. It is also the second largest producer of wine in the world, the second largest producer of milk in Europe, and the third largest producer of fruits and vegetables in Europe.

French agriculture is supported by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, receiving 8.95 billion euros of financing in 2015, or 21% of the CAP's total budget. France generated an agri-food trade surplus of 6.1 billion euros in 2016.

#### Industry and manufacturing

France is the world's fourth industrial power. In 2014, industrial companies represented 12.6% of GDP and 96.5% of French exports. The country is a leader in many industrial sectors, including automotive, aeronautics, aerospace, agri-food, electronics, nuclear power, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and luxury goods.

The French arms industry is particularly significant, employing 165,000 people in 2013 and covering a wide spectrum of products, from shipbuilding to military aviation and weapons systems. Arms exports reached 16 billion euros in 2015 and more than 20 billion euros in 2016.

France is also notable for its autonomous space program, with the National Center for Space Studies (CNES) being the most important space agency in Europe. France became the third nation to send a satellite into space by its own means in 1965, and today operates the Ariane rocket program through the European Space Agency.

#### Energy

France is highly dependent on nuclear power, which provided about 70% of its electricity in 2021, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin. This dependency resulted from a strategic decision following the 1973 oil crisis to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. France has 56 operational nuclear reactors, the second largest fleet in the world after the United States.

Hydropower is the most significant renewable energy source, contributing 13% of France's electricity, the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey. Other renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and biomass, are growing but still represent a relatively small share of the energy mix.

The energy sector in France employed 194,000 people in 2008 and contributed 2.1% to GDP. The country has very small deposits of oil and natural gas and imports the vast majority of its fossil fuel needs. The French group Total is one of the world's largest oil companies.

#### Tourism

France is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving approximately 90 million international tourist arrivals in 2019 (pre-COVID). Despite this, it ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits compared to other countries like the United States and Spain.

The tourist appeal of France stems from its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, renowned gastronomy, temperate climate, and excellent transport infrastructure. Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, and the Louvre Museum is the most visited museum globally (10 million visitors in 2018).

Tourism in France is diverse, including cultural tourism (especially in Paris), seaside tourism (particularly on the French Riviera), natural tourism, business tourism, leisure tourism (Disneyland Paris is the most visited amusement park in Europe), and winter sports (especially in the Alps). The most visited paid tourist sites are mostly located in the Île-de-France region.

Tourism receipts linked to international tourism in France amounted to 69.89 billion US dollars in 2017, making it the second country with the highest tourism receipts, behind the United States and ahead of Spain and Thailand. In 2015, domestic tourism consumption amounted to 160 billion euros, or 7.2% of France's GDP.

#### Services and finance

The service sector dominates the French economy, accounting for 78.8% of GDP in 2017 according to the CIA World Factbook. Major service industries include retail, tourism, banking, insurance, and business services.

The French banking sector has undergone significant consolidation and internationalization since the 1990s. French banks BNP Paribas, Société Générale, and Crédit Agricole are among the largest in the world, ranking fourth, ninth, and tenth globally in 2009.

The retail sector has been revolutionized since the 1970s by the emergence of large-scale distribution, which represents two-thirds of French food expenditure. Major groups like Carrefour (the second largest retail group worldwide) have significant market power that allows them to influence producer prices.

#### Creative and cultural industries

The cultural industry has a considerably larger share in France's economy than in many other countries. The total volume amounted to 74 billion euros in 2012, of which 61.4 billion were directly generated. The French cultural industry, with its direct revenues, is larger than the automotive sector or the producers of luxury goods and is only slightly behind telecommunications.

Several major global cultural enterprises are headquartered in France. In 2013, Universal Music Group was the largest music publisher in the world, Groupe Lagardère was the second largest book publisher, and Ubisoft was the third largest provider of computer games. France ranked second among film production countries and was the fourth largest art market in the world.

### Research and innovation

France devotes about 2% of its GDP to research and development, with the public sector playing a larger role than in many other developed countries. Despite numerous discoveries and scientific prizes, the number of patents filed by French companies is relatively low compared to other major economies, partly due to weak links between private companies and public research.

In 2015, about 280,000 researchers worked in France, including 170,000 in companies and 110,000 in the civil service. Public research is conducted at universities and in establishments such as the CNRS (generalist), the CEA (nuclear), INRIA (computer science and applied mathematics), and INRA (agronomy).

France hosts several major international research facilities, including the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the Institut Laue-Langevin, and the Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique, and remains a key player in CERN. Since 2002, most of these research centers have been organized in networks with universities and companies to form competitiveness clusters (71 in 2007).

## Demographics

### Population trends

According to INSEE, France had a population of approximately 68.6 million inhabitants as of January 2025, including 66.4 million in metropolitan France and 2.2 million in the overseas departments. The population of all French territories, including the overseas collectivities and New Caledonia, reaches about 69.2 million.

After having a relatively low demographic growth in the 19th and early 20th centuries, France has experienced stronger population growth than most European countries since the mid-20th century. This is due to a combination of factors: a higher fertility rate than the European average, a positive migration balance, and increasing life expectancy.

In 2015, the fertility rate in France was about 1.96 children per woman, among the highest in Europe. The country's population increased by 0.4% in 2015, with 800,000 births against 600,000 deaths and a positive migration balance of about 47,000.

According to Eurostat projections, France should reach 72.7 million inhabitants by 2040, 75.6 million by 2060, and 78.8 million by 2080 (excluding overseas territories and New Caledonia).

The age structure of the French population has been evolving, with an increasing proportion of older people. The share of people over 60 grew from 17% in 1980 to 25% in 2016 and is projected to approach one-third by 2050. Life expectancy in France is among the highest in the world, standing at 82.7 years in total (85.3 for women and 79.2 for men in 2020).

### Immigration and ethnic diversity

France has a long history of immigration, which has accelerated since the mid-20th century. According to the United Nations definition, France hosted 7.2 million immigrants in 2010, representing 11.1% of the population. This places it sixth in the world, behind the United States, Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Canada.

In 2015, using the more restrictive French definition (born foreign outside the territory), France had 6.17 million immigrants, or 9.3% of the population. The number and share of immigrants have continuously increased since 1946: from 1.99 million (4.98% of the total population) in 1946 to 5.34 million (8.44%) in 2008.

The origins of immigrants have diversified over time. In 2015, 44.6% of immigrants came from Africa (up from 27% in 1975), 35.4% from Europe (down from 66% in 1975), 14.3% from Asia (up from 4% in 1975), and 5.6% from the Americas or Oceania. In 2013, 39% of immigrants had acquired French nationality, up from 28% in 1975.

Children of immigrants represented 10.4% of the total population in 2013, meaning that immigrants and their children made up 19.3% of the French population. In 2014, 29.2% of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and 25.7% had at least one parent born outside the European Union.

Major immigrant communities in France include those from North Africa (estimated at 3.8 million people of North African origin in 2011), Turkey (630,000 in 2018), China (nearly 600,000 in 2014), and Vietnam (150,000 in 2010).

While France does not collect official statistics on ethnicity or race, historian Pascal Blanchard estimated in 2015 that between 12 and 14 million French people (18% to 22% of the total population) have at least one of their grandparents born in a non-European territory.

### Languages

French is the sole official language of France and is spoken by the vast majority of the population. It became the language of administration in 1539 through the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts. The French language developed from the dialect of the Île-de-France region (francien) with influences from other regional dialects. As of 1992, the Constitution states that "the language of the Republic is French."

According to a report by linguist Bernard Cerquiglini (1999), seventy-five languages other than French are spoken in France, including regional languages, languages from immigration, and dialects spoken in the overseas territories. Regional languages, though not having official status, have been recognized since 2008 as belonging to the heritage of France by Article 75-1 of the Constitution.

The main regional languages in metropolitan France include:

- Oïl languages (sometimes considered French dialects): Picard, Norman, Gallo, Poitevin-Saintongeais, Walloon, Champenois
- Occitan in southern France
- Franco-Provençal in the Alpine and Jura regions
- Catalan in the Pyrénées-Orientales department
- Alsatian and Lorraine Franconian in northeastern France
- Basque in the extreme southwest
- Breton in the northwest
- Corsican on Corsica
- Flemish in the north

In overseas territories, various languages are spoken, including Creole languages, Polynesian languages, and Kanak languages in New Caledonia.

The use of regional languages has declined significantly over the 20th century due to the policy of promoting French. However, there have been efforts to preserve and revive these languages in recent decades, though with limited success. Teaching programs for regional languages exist but remain very limited.

The French government actively promotes the French language both domestically and internationally, notably through the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The 1994 Toubon Law mandates the use of French in official government publications, advertisements, workplaces, and commercial contracts.

### Religion

France is officially a secular state, with the principle of laïcité (separation of church and state) enshrined in the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. The government neither recognizes nor subsidizes any religion, with the historical exception of Alsace-Moselle (which was not part of France when the 1905 law was passed) and some overseas territories.

Religious demographics in France are difficult to determine precisely as the state does not collect data on religious affiliation. According to various surveys:

- Catholicism remains the largest religion, with about 48% of respondents identifying as Catholic in 2019 polls, though regular practice is much lower.
- Islam is the second largest religion, with estimates ranging from 5 to 10% of the population.
- Protestantism represents about 3% of the population.
- Judaism accounts for approximately 1%.
- Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions are practiced by smaller minorities.
- A significant and growing proportion of the population identifies as atheist, agnostic, or without religion (30-40% depending on surveys).

The loss of influence of religions is a major aspect of the evolution of French society in the 19th and 20th centuries. According to a 2017 Ipsos poll, 61% of French people think that religion causes more harm than good, and only 16% think that religious people make better citizens.

Historically, France was predominantly Catholic, and the French kings bore the title of "Most Christian King" (roi très chrétien). Religious conflicts, particularly the Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants in the 16th century, have marked French history. In the 20th century, immigration brought significant Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu communities to France.

The Jewish community in France, one of the largest in Europe, has had a complex history of persecution and acceptance. Anti-Semitism remains a concern, with reports indicating that thousands of Jewish emigrants leave France each year.

Islam has grown significantly through immigration from North Africa and the Middle East. The French state promotes a "Gallicization of Islam" and requires that Islamic organizations establish a corporate body as a central point of contact with the state.

### Education

Education in France is highly centralized and organized into three stages: primary, secondary, and higher education. The Ministry of National Education establishes the curriculum at all levels, and teachers in public schools are civil servants. Public education is secular and free. Education is compulsory for children aged 3 to 16 (previously 6 to 16 until 2019).

Primary education is divided into école maternelle (nursery school, ages 3-6) and école élémentaire (elementary school, ages 6-11). Secondary education consists of collège (middle school, ages 11-15) leading to the brevet des collèges, followed by lycée (high school, ages 15-18) leading to the baccalauréat.

Higher education in France is characterized by a dual system: universities and grandes écoles. Universities are public institutions that offer a wide range of programs and are open to all students who have passed the baccalauréat. Grandes écoles are highly selective institutions that train France's political, scientific, and business elite. Entry typically requires passing competitive exams after preparatory classes (classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles or CPGE).

The democratization of education has been significant since the Liberation. In 1936, less than 3% of an age group obtained the baccalauréat; this percentage rose to 30% in 1985 and 60% in 1995. However, social inequalities persist: 77% of children of executives born between 1974 and 1978 have higher education diplomas, compared to only 25% of children of workers.

According to the PISA program, which compares national education systems, France's results are in the middle range among OECD countries. The country has seen increasing educational inequalities since the 2003 PISA survey. Despite prevention plans, illiteracy affects 3.1 million people, or 9% of the population aged 18 to 65 who have been educated in France.

The social origin of students significantly influences their academic results. In CE2 (8-year-olds), students from the poorest quarter obtained in 2019 an average score of 57 out of 100 in French and 58 in mathematics, compared to 87 and 85 respectively for those from the richest quarter.

### Health

France has a universal health care system largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the "best overall health care" in the world. In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita, a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe.

Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy is 80 years for men and 85.6 years for women. There are 3.2 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants and 5.7 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants.

The French health system is largely financed by the illness branch of Social Security. Health expenditure per inhabitant was $4,719 per year in 2008, which places France above its major European neighbors but below countries like Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, and the United States. From 1950 to 2006, the expenditure devoted to care and medical goods increased from 2.5% to 8.8% of GDP.

Despite the generally high quality of healthcare, there are health challenges. The French remain among the highest consumers of alcohol in Western Europe. In 2005, 29% of 18-75 year-olds smoked daily despite intensive anti-smoking campaigns. Cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug, with 39% of men aged 18 to 25 having consumed it in 2005, according to the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction. A 2020 study by ANSES revealed that 95% of the adult French population is exposed to health risks due to lack of physical activity or too much time spent sitting.

### Social protection

Social Security (Sécurité sociale) has been at the heart of the French social protection system since its creation in 1945. It is divided into four branches corresponding to the four major risks: illness, work accidents and occupational diseases, risks related to old age, and family. Initially covering only active workers, it has gradually extended to the entire active and inactive population in many areas, for example with the creation of universal health coverage (CMU) in 1999.

Social benefits are mainly financed by social contributions paid by active workers (65.5% of the total in 2005), but also—and increasingly—by the State and territorial collectivities. In 2005, social protection expenditure represented nearly 30% of GDP and more than 45% of the adjusted disposable income of households.

The French social model includes strong worker protections, extensive collective bargaining rights, and generous social benefits. However, the sustainability of this system has been questioned due to demographic challenges (aging population) and economic pressures (high unemployment, public debt).

## Culture

French culture has been shaped by deep historical roots, significant regional variations, and the country's position as a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and philosophy. France derives its cultural prominence in part from its active promotion and protection of its heritage, both at home and globally.

### Art

The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France.

In the 18th century, French artists developed the rococo style as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly created the Museum Central des Arts in the former royal palace of the Louvre, establishing a model for art museums that spread throughout Europe.

The 19th century saw the development of numerous artistic movements in France, including Neoclassicism (Jacques-Louis David), Romanticism (Eugène Delacroix), Realism (Gustave Courbet), and Impressionism (Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir). Post-Impressionist painters such as Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent van Gogh developed in France, as did the Fauvist movement (Henri Matisse, André Derain).

In the early 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, who lived in Paris. Many other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, and Wassily Kandinsky.

France has many important art museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (7.7 million visitors in 2022), the Musée d'Orsay specializing in Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie housing Monet's Water Lilies, and the Centre Georges Pompidou dedicated to modern and contemporary art.

### Architecture

French architecture spans a rich variety of styles across many centuries. The oldest architectural traces left by Romans include the Pont du Gard and the amphitheater of Nîmes. From the Middle Ages, many sacred buildings have been preserved, including Romanesque churches such as Saint-Sernin de Toulouse and Gothic cathedrals like Notre-Dame de Paris, Chartres, and Amiens.

During the Renaissance, French architects interpreted this art form in their own way, creating numerous châteaux throughout the Loire Valley, such as Chambord, Chenonceau, and Amboise. Classicism dominated during the reign of Louis XIV, with the Palace of Versailles becoming the model for royal courts across Europe.

In the 19th century, architectural revivals (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque) and new technology led to the creation of innovative structures like the Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 World's Fair. The early 20th century saw the emergence of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, visible in many Metro entrances in Paris designed by Hector Guimard and buildings such as the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.

Modernist architecture gained prominence through the work of Le Corbusier, while recent decades have seen bold architectural projects such as the Centre Pompidou, the Louvre Pyramid by I.M. Pei, and the Grande Arche de la Défense. French architects like Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, and Christian de Portzamparc continue to create innovative designs worldwide.

### Literature and philosophy

French literature has deep roots in the Middle Ages with epic poems like the Song of Roland and the works of Chrétien de Troyes. The humanist movement of the Renaissance brought writers such as François Rabelais and Michel de Montaigne. The 17th century, known as the Grand Siècle, saw the flourishing of theatrical works by Molière, Pierre Corneille, and Jean Racine, while La Fontaine wrote his famous Fables.

The Enlightenment in the 18th century established France as an intellectual center with philosophers like Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Denis Diderot, whose Encyclopédie sought to summarize all human knowledge. The 19th century is often considered a golden age for French literature, with writers such as Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, and Charles Baudelaire.

In the early 20th century, Marcel Proust wrote his monumental In Search of Lost Time, while the post-World War I period saw the rise of Surrealism with André Breton and the emergence of existentialist philosophy with Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. France has produced more Nobel Prize winners in Literature (16) than any other country.

French philosophy has played a central role in Western thought. René Descartes' rationalism in the 17th century laid the foundation for modern philosophy. The Enlightenment philosophers advanced ideas of liberty, progress, and tolerance that influenced the French Revolution and modern democratic thought. In the 20th century, existentialism, structuralism with Claude Lévi-Strauss, and post-structuralism with Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida have had worldwide impact.

### Cinema

France has a special place in the history of cinema, as the Lumière brothers are credited with inventing the cinematograph and holding the first public screening of films in Paris in 1895. The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also French.

The French film industry has been historically strong, producing many influential movements like the avant-garde of the 1920s, poetic realism of the 1930s, and the New Wave (Nouvelle Vague) of the late 1950s and 1960s. Directors like Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, and Claude Chabrol revolutionized filmmaking with techniques such as jump cuts and location shooting.

The country hosts the Cannes Film Festival, one of the world's oldest and most prestigious film festivals. France has continued to produce critically acclaimed directors like Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie), Jacques Audiard, Claire Denis, and Céline Sciamma.

The French government strongly supports its film industry through quotas and subsidies. This system has helped France maintain a vibrant national cinema despite Hollywood's global dominance. In fact, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.

### Music

France has a rich musical tradition spanning centuries. In the medieval period, sacred music flourished, and the Notre Dame School developed polyphony. The troubadours and trouvères created secular songs that spread throughout Europe.

The Baroque period saw composers like Jean-Baptiste Lully, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, and Jean-Philippe Rameau achieve prominence. The 19th century brought Romantic composers such as Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, Georges Bizet, and Camille Saint-Saëns.

The early 20th century saw the emergence of Impressionist music with Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, while composers like Erik Satie and the Group of Six (Les Six) challenged conventions. Pierre Boulez became a leading figure in post-war avant-garde music.

In popular music, the French chanson tradition has been carried by artists like Édith Piaf, Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens, and Charles Aznavour. Since the 1960s, France has produced rock, pop, and electronic music artists, including Jean-Michel Jarre, Air, Daft Punk, and Phoenix. Hip-hop and rap have gained popularity since the 1990s, with artists like MC Solaar and later IAM and NTM.

Music from France's former colonies has also influenced French culture, particularly North African raï music and various African styles. Regional musical traditions remain strong in areas like Brittany, Corsica, and the Basque Country.

### Fashion

Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "haute couture" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV. France renewed its dominance of high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy.

According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor. Moreover, France possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.

### Cuisine

French cuisine is renowned worldwide for its sophistication and influence on other culinary traditions. In 2010, UNESCO added the "gastronomic meal of the French" to its list of the world's intangible cultural heritage, recognizing the importance of food in French culture.

Different regions of France have distinct culinary traditions: butter and cream are common ingredients in the north, while olive oil is more prevalent in the south. Each region has specialties: cassoulet in the southwest, choucroute in Alsace, quiche in the Lorraine region, beef bourguignon in Burgundy, and tapenade in Provence.

France is famous for its wines and cheeses, many of which are named for the territories where they are produced (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée or AOC). A typical French meal consists of three courses: entrée (starter), plat principal (main course), and fromage (cheese) or dessert, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.

The Michelin Guide, which awards stars for excellence to select restaurants, originated in France in 1900 as a guide for motorists. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants. The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on a restaurant's success.

In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Lorraine. French rum is made in distilleries on islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

### Sports

Sports play an important role in French culture. France hosts "the world's biggest annual sporting event," the Tour de France cycling race, and has been influential in the modern Olympic movement, with Pierre de Coubertin founding the International Olympic Committee in 1894.

Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in France, with over 1.8 million registered players and 18,000 registered clubs. The French national football team, known as "Les Bleus," won the FIFA World Cup in 1998 and 2018, and the UEFA European Championship in 1984 and 2000. France has hosted the FIFA World Cup twice (1938 and 1998) and the European Championship three times (1960, 1984, and 2016).

Rugby is particularly popular in the southwest. The French rugby union team has reached the World Cup final three times and has won the Six Nations Championship 26 times, including ten Grand Slams. The country has hosted the Rugby World Cup in 1991, 2007, and 2023.

Other popular sports include tennis (with the French Open being one of the four Grand Slam tournaments), handball (the men's team has won six world championships), basketball, judo, and pétanque. Winter sports are significant, with nearly seven million French people practicing skiing each winter, making the French ski area the most frequented in the world in 2015.

France has hosted the Summer Olympics three times (1900, 1924, and 2024) and the Winter Olympics three times (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble, and 1992 in Albertville). The country will also host the 2030 Winter Olympics in the French Alps.

Motorsport is another area where France excels, particularly with events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the oldest and most prestigious automobile races in the world. France also has a growing presence in e-sports, with Team Vitality being one of Europe's most successful organizations.
