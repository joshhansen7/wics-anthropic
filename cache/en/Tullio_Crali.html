# Tullio Crali

**Tullio Crali** (6 December 1910, in [Igalo](/article/en/Igalo) – 5 August 2000, in [Milan](/article/en/Milan)) was an Italian painter, watercolorist, architect, and sculptor associated with [Futurism](/article/en/Futurism). A self-taught artist and late adherent to the movement, he joined in 1929 and became one of the most prominent representatives of [Aeropittura](/article/en/Aeropittura) (futurist aerial painting). He is noted for realistic paintings that combine "speed, aerial mechanisation and the mechanics of aerial warfare," though throughout his long career he explored multiple artistic styles.

## Early Life

Crali was born in a small village in the [Bay of Kotor](/article/en/Bay_of_Kotor) on the coast of present-day [Montenegro](/article/en/Montenegro), which at the time was part of the [Kingdom of Dalmatia](/article/en/Kingdom_of_Dalmatia) within [Austria-Hungary](/article/en/Austria-Hungary). He belonged to the Dalmatian Italian minority community. His family originated from [Zadar](/article/en/Zadar) (Italian: Zara) in [Dalmatia](/article/en/Dalmatia), and lived there until 1922, when they relocated to [Gorizia](/article/en/Gorizia) in [Friuli](/article/en/Friuli).

At the age of fifteen, while a student at the local technical institute, Crali discovered Futurism. He began painting around 1925, influenced by artists such as [Giacomo Balla](/article/en/Giacomo_Balla), [Enrico Prampolini](/article/en/Enrico_Prampolini), and [Umberto Boccioni](/article/en/Umberto_Boccioni). His early artistic development was shaped by these modernist pioneers.

## Career

### Entry into Futurism and Aeropittura

In 1928, Crali flew for the first time, an experience that profoundly influenced his artistic direction. His enthusiasm for aviation and his experience as a pilot became central to his work. In 1929, through the intermediary Sofronio Pocarini, he made contact with [Filippo Tommaso Marinetti](/article/en/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti), the founder of [Futurism](/article/en/Futurism), and officially joined the movement.

That same year, 1929, marked the formal inauguration of Aeropittura (aeropaint) through the manifesto *Perspectives of Flight* (also known as the *Manifesto of Aeropainting*), signed by [Benedetta](/article/en/Benedetta_Cappa), [Depero](/article/en/Fortunato_Depero), [Dottori](/article/en/Gerardo_Dottori), [Fillia](/article/en/Fillia) (Colombo), Marinetti, Prampolini, Somenzi, and Guglielmo Sansoni ([Tato](/article/en/Tato)). The manifesto declared that "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything."

Despite his relative youth and late entry into Futurism, Crali played a significant role in the movement's aeropaint development. His earliest aeropitturas depicted military aircraft, including *Aerial Squadron* (1929) and *Aerial Duel* (1929). During the 1930s, his paintings became increasingly realistic, designed to communicate the lived experience of flight to viewers. His most celebrated work, *Incuneandosi nell'abitato* (1939)—also known as *In tuffo sulla città* (*Nose Dive on the City*)—depicts an aerial dive from the pilot's point of view, with buildings below rendered in vertiginous perspective.

### Exhibitions and Recognition

Crali exhibited his works in [Trieste](/article/en/Trieste) and [Padua](/article/en/Padua). In 1932, Marinetti invited him to exhibit in [Paris](/article/en/Paris) at the first Aeropittura exhibition held outside Italy. He subsequently participated in major international exhibitions, including the [Rome Quadriennale](/article/en/Rome_Quadriennale) in 1935, 1939, and 1943, and the [Venice Biennale](/article/en/Venice_Biennale) in 1940. In 1933, his interest in signs and scenography led him to participate in the film exhibition *Futuristi Scenotecnica* in Rome. In 1936, he exhibited at the International Exhibition of Sports Art at the [Berlin Olympics](/article/en/1936_Summer_Olympics).

### Manifestos and Events

Crali's declamatory abilities and his personal friendship with Marinetti led him to organize Futurist evenings in Gorizia, Udine, and Trieste. At these events, he read the manifesto *Plastic Illusionism of War and Protecting the Earth* (also referred to as *Plastic Illusionism of War and Perfection of the Earth*), which he co-authored with Marinetti. He also published the *Manifesto of Musical Words - Alphabet in Freedom*.

During this period, Crali was researching signs and scenery, contributing to the development of [stage design](/article/en/Scenic_design) theories within the Futurist movement.

### Post-World War II Era

Following World War II, Crali lived in [Turin](/article/en/Turin), where he continued to promote Futurist events. Despite the death of Marinetti in 1944 and the end of the formal Futurist movement, as well as Futurism's association with [Fascism](/article/en/Fascism), Crali remained devoted to Futurist ideals and aesthetics throughout his life.

Between 1950 and 1958, he lived in [Paris](/article/en/Paris), making occasional visits to [Britain](/article/en/United_Kingdom). From 1962 to 1966, he taught at the Italian Academy of Fine Arts (Scuola d'Arte Italia) in [Cairo](/article/en/Cairo), [Egypt](/article/en/Egypt). From 1958 to 1961, he also taught Drawing and Art History at the Vittorio Veneto Scientific High School in Milan.

### Sassintesi and Later Developments

In 1959, Crali published *Sassintesi* ("Stone Syntheses"), the first post-war Futurist manifesto. In this work, he advocated a new form of artistic expression using natural materials—pebbles, stones, and rocks of various minerals. According to the manifesto: "The inherent qualities of colour, form, translucence, texture, etc. were to suggest, develop and determine the idea of the artist, while their appearance and positioning produced a harmonious composition that relied much on the stones' natural symbiosis with the cosmos." His sassintesi works were exhibited in Milan in 1961.

In the late 1960s, Crali attempted to revive Aeropittura through the manifesto *Orbital Art*. His painting *Frecce Tricolori* (1966) depicts jet fighter planes in this renewed style. He continued to paint, sculpt, teach, and lecture throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

In 1966, he moved to Milan, where he remained for the rest of his life. There, he began systematically collecting and cataloging documents and materials related to his life and work. In 1999, he donated his archive and 41 works to the [Museo di arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto](/article/en/MART_(museum)) (MART) in [Rovereto](/article/en/Rovereto). Following his death in 2000, an additional 48 works were added to this collection.

## Personal Life

Crali was married to Adolfina Savelli. He had one son, Massimo (died 3 February 2008), and three granddaughters: Marzia, Vibia, and Lavinia. At his own wish, Crali was buried in [Macerata](/article/en/Macerata) cemetery, a city he had come to know during [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II) and continued to visit throughout his life. His wife and granddaughters subsequently resided in Macerata.

## Legacy

Crali's extensive archive and artworks are preserved at the [MART](/article/en/MART_(museum)) in Rovereto, making him one of the best-documented Futurist artists. His contributions to Aeropittura represent a bridge between the movement's theoretical manifestos and visual representation, particularly in depicting the subjective experience of flight. His later innovations, including Sassintesi and Orbital Art, demonstrate his continued commitment to avant-garde artistic experimentation long after the formal conclusion of the Futurist movement.

His work exemplifies the tension between Futurism's association with Fascism and the genuine artistic innovations of the movement, a complexity he navigated by maintaining his artistic principles while living through significant historical changes.
