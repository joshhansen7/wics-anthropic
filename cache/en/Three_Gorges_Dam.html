# Three Gorges Dam

The **Three Gorges Dam** (simplified Chinese: 三峡大坝; traditional Chinese: 三峽大壩; pinyin: Sānxiá dàbà), officially known as the **Yangtze River Three Gorges Water Conservancy Project**, is a [gravity dam](/article/en/Gravity_dam) that spans the [Yangtze River](/article/en/Yangtze_River) near Sandouping in Yiling District, [Yichang](/article/en/Yichang), [Hubei](/article/en/Hubei_Province) province, central [China](/article/en/China), located within the Xiling Gorge of the [Three Gorges](/article/en/Three_Gorges), approximately 38 kilometers upstream of the [Gezhouba Dam](/article/en/Gezhouba_Dam).

The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest [hydroelectric power station](/article/en/Hydroelectric_power_station) by installed capacity, with 22,500 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity. It generates an average of 95±20 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity per year, depending on precipitation patterns in the river basin. Following exceptionally heavy monsoons in 2020, the dam produced nearly 112 TWh, breaking the previous world record of approximately 103 TWh set by [Brazil](/article/en/Brazil)'s [Itaipu Dam](/article/en/Itaipu_Dam) in 2016.

The dam's concrete and steel structure measures 2,335 meters (7,661 feet) in length and 185 meters (607 feet) in height above sea level. Construction of the main dam body was completed in 2006, while the power plant became fully operational in 2012 when the last of 32 main turbines came online. The ship lift, the final major component, was completed in January 2016 and became operational in September 2016.

## Overview and Characteristics

### Physical Dimensions and Composition

The Three Gorges Dam is constructed of reinforced concrete and steel. The dam wall itself is 181 meters (594 feet) above its rock foundation. The project utilized 27.2 million cubic meters of concrete—the largest quantity used in a single construction project—along with 463,000 tonnes of steel (equivalent to the material needed to construct 63 [Eiffel Towers](/article/en/Eiffel_Tower)) and required the excavation and movement of approximately 102.6 million cubic meters of earth.

The dam consists of several functional sections from west to east (facing downstream):
- Permanent ship locks
- Ship lift
- Sand discharge channel (temporary locks, later converted)
- Left bank dam and hydroelectric power station
- Central spillway section
- Right bank dam and hydroelectric power station
- Underground hydroelectric power station

### Reservoir Characteristics

When the water level reaches its design maximum of 175 meters (574 feet) above sea level—110 meters higher than the river level downstream—the reservoir extends approximately 660 kilometers (410 miles) in length with an average width of 1.12 kilometers (3,675 feet). The reservoir contains 39.3 cubic kilometers (31.9 million acre-feet) of water and has a total surface area of 1,045 square kilometers (403 square miles). The reservoir's flood storage capacity is approximately 22 cubic kilometers (5.3 cubic miles).

Upon completion, the reservoir flooded approximately 632 square kilometers (156,000 acres) of land, significantly less than the 1,350 square kilometers (330,000 acres) flooded by the Itaipu Dam. The maximum water level was first reached on October 26, 2010.

## Generators and Power Generation

### Generator Specifications

The Three Gorges Dam is equipped with 34 generators: 32 main generators and 2 auxiliary generators. The arrangement consists of:
- 14 main generators on the left bank
- 12 main generators on the right bank
- 6 main generators in an underground power station on the south side
- 2 auxiliary 50 MW generators

Each of the 32 main generators has a nominal capacity of 700 MW, with a rated power of 778 MVA and maximum capacity of 840 MVA. The combined capacity is 22,500 MW (22.5 GW), making the Three Gorges Dam far more powerful than the next-largest hydroelectric facility, [Brazil](/article/en/Brazil)'s 12,600 MW Itaipu Dam.

### Generator Design and Manufacturing

Each main generator weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and is designed to produce more than 700 MW of power. The generators utilize [Francis turbines](/article/en/Francis_turbine) with diameters ranging from 9.7 to 10.4 meters, depending on design variant, and operate at 75 revolutions per minute. To generate power at 50 Hz frequency, the rotor has 80 poles.

The designed hydraulic head is 80.6 meters (264 feet), though the actual head varies between 79 and 109 meters depending on water levels. Water flow rates vary between 600–950 cubic meters per second depending on the available head; greater head requires less water to achieve full capacity.

Electricity is generated at 20 kV and then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generators achieve average efficiency exceeding 94%, with a maximum efficiency of 96.5%.

The generators' stator components represent the largest of their kind globally:
- Height: 3.0–3.1 meters
- Outer diameter: 20.9–21.4 meters
- Inner diameter: 18.5–18.8 meters
- Bearing load: 5,050–5,500 tonnes

The generators were manufactured by two joint venture consortiums:

1. **Alstom, ABB, Kvaerner**, and the Chinese company **Harbin Motor**
2. **Voith, General Electric, Siemens (VGS)**, and the Chinese company **Oriental Motor**

Technology transfer agreements accompanied the manufacturing contracts. Most generators use water cooling, though some newer units employ air cooling, which offers advantages in design simplicity, manufacturing, and maintenance.

## Power Distribution and Economics

### Distribution Network

The State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid initially paid a flat rate of ¥250 per MWh (approximately US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, pricing has varied by province, ranging from ¥228.7 to ¥401.8 per MWh. Provinces and cities with higher payment rates, such as [Shanghai](/article/en/Shanghai), receive priority in electricity distribution.

Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam. Power is distributed through an extensive transmission infrastructure completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule, at a cost of 34.387 billion yuan (approximately US$5 billion).

**High-voltage transmission lines include:**

- **Three direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid** with total capacity of 7,200 MW:
  - Three Gorges–Shanghai: 3,000 MW
  - Three Gorges–Changzhou: 3,000 MW
  - Gezhouba–Shanghai: 1,200 MW

- **Alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid** with total capacity of 12,000 MW

- **HVDC line to the South China Grid**: 3,000 MW capacity

The transmission network consists of 9,484 kilometers of high-voltage lines, including 6,519 kilometers of 500 kV AC lines and 2,965 kilometers of ±500 kV DC lines and above. The total installed capacity of AC transformers is 22.75 GVA, and the DC system capacity is 18 GW.

### Economic Performance and Cost Recovery

The [Chinese government](/article/en/Government_of_China) initially estimated the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (approximately US$22.5–26.9 billion). By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, distributed as follows:
- 64.613 billion yuan: Construction
- 68.557 billion yuan: Relocation of affected residents
- 15.195 billion yuan: Financing costs

The final estimated total investment was approximately 203.9 billion yuan (approximately US$30.5 billion).

Funding sources included:
- Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund
- Profits from the Gezhouba Dam
- Loans from the [China Development Bank](/article/en/China_Development_Bank)
- Loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks
- Corporate bonds
- Revenue from electricity generation (before and after full operation)

Additional charges were assessed to provinces: every province receiving power from the dam paid an extra ¥7.00 per MWh, while other provinces paid ¥4.00 per MWh surcharges. The Tibet Autonomous Region was exempt from these surcharges.

In 2009, it was estimated that cost recovery would occur when the dam had generated 1,000 TWh of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan and requiring approximately ten years after full operational status. In fact, the project fully recovered its construction costs by December 20, 2013—four years after initial turbines began operating and just one year after official commissioning of all units.

### Power Generation Economics

Despite being the world's largest capacity hydroelectric station, the Three Gorges Dam supplies less than 1.0% of China's electricity demand as of 2024, when Chinese electricity demand reached 9,852.1 TWh. This reflects the rapid growth of electricity consumption in China, which has outpaced the dam's generation capacity. Originally projected to provide 10% of national electricity supply, the dam ultimately generates only a small fraction due to the enormous expansion of China's total electricity consumption.

In terms of emissions reduction, the dam's generation of approximately 100 billion kWh annually is equivalent to burning 31.9 million tonnes of standard coal, with annual direct [carbon dioxide](/article/en/Carbon_dioxide) emissions reduction of approximately 85.8 million tonnes.

## History

### Early Concept and Proposals (1919–1947)

The idea of constructing a large dam across the Yangtze River originated with [Sun Yat-sen](/article/en/Sun_Yat-sen), founder of the [Republic of China](/article/en/Republic_of_China). In his 1919 work "[The International Development of China](/article/en/The_International_Development_of_China)," Sun envisioned a dam downstream of the Three Gorges capable of generating 30 million horsepower (22 GW)—a capacity remarkably close to the dam's actual specifications completed nearly a century later.

In 1932, the [Nationalist government](/article/en/Kuomintang) led by [Chiang Kai-shek](/article/en/Chiang_Kai-shek) began preliminary work on dam construction plans. In 1939, during the [Second Sino-Japanese War](/article/en/Second_Sino-Japanese_War), [Japanese](/article/en/Empire_of_Japan) military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area, developing their own dam proposal.

In 1944, [John L. Savage](/article/en/John_L._Savage), chief design engineer of the [United States Bureau of Reclamation](/article/en/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation) and designer of [Hoover Dam](/article/en/Hoover_Dam), surveyed the Three Gorges area at the invitation of the [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing) Nationalist government. Savage produced the "Yangtze Gorge and Tributary Project" (commonly known as the "Savage Plan"), proposing a dam between Nanjinguan and Shipa with a height of 225 meters, total capacity of 10.56 million kilowatts, and functions including flood control, navigation, and irrigation.

Approximately 54 Chinese engineers were trained in the [United States](/article/en/United_States) to participate in the project. The original plans called for a unique ship passage method: vessels would enter locks at the dam's lower and upper ends, then cranes would move them from each lock chamber to the next, with groups of craft lifted together for efficiency. Whether this system was chosen for water conservation or because engineers believed the height difference too great for conventional locks remains uncertain.

In 1945, the Chongqing Nationalist government provisionally approved Savage's plan. The Resource Commission established the National Hydroelectric Power Engineering General Office in 1945 in Changshuo County, [Sichuan](/article/en/Sichuan_Province), with a Three Gorges Survey Office in Yichang handling survey and drilling work. In 1946, Savage returned to China, conducting additional topographic surveys and economic investigations. The Resource Commission signed contracts with the American [Morrison-Knudsen](/article/en/Morrison-Knudsen) Company and the Bureau of Reclamation for geological drilling and design work. Design and construction activities progressed through geological drilling, aerial surveying, and economic studies.

In May 1947, the Three Gorges survey was abandoned due to a combination of factors: the resignation of Premier [Song Ziwen](/article/en/Song_Ziwen) in March 1947 following corruption scandals, the April 1947 resignation of Resource Commission Chairman Qian Changzhao (who had directed the survey), and the resumption of the [Chinese Civil War](/article/en/Chinese_Civil_War), which made it impossible to secure adequate funding. By August 1947, all design work ceased, and personnel gradually returned to China. According to Qian's recollections, Savage departed China nearly in tears over the project's abandonment.

### Early Communist Era (1949–1977)

After the [Communist victory](/article/en/Chinese_Communist_Revolution) in 1949 and establishment of the [People's Republic of China](/article/en/People's_Republic_of_China), [Mao Zedong](/article/en/Mao_Zedong) expressed support for the Three Gorges project but decided to first construct the smaller [Gezhouba Dam](/article/en/Gezhouba_Dam) as a preliminary test project. In early 1953, when Mao inspected the Three Gorges, he declared: "The Three Gorges Water Control Project is something that needs to be built and is possible to build," but emphasized that "the final decision to build it and when to begin construction must be made only after the preparatory work in all major aspects is basically completed." He also composed lines from "[Prelude to Water Melody: Swimming](/article/en/Prelude_to_Water_Melody:_Swimming)" expressing his vision: "erect anew a stone wall on the western river, block the clouds and rain of Wushan, high gorges yield a level lake."

Under Mao's direction, [Premier Zhou Enlai](/article/en/Zhou_Enlai) oversaw early exploration, design, and demonstration work, with participation from Soviet water conservancy experts. The period witnessed intense debate within China's water conservancy community. Supporters like [Lin Yishan](/article/en/Lin_Yishan) argued that a large dam was essential for flood prevention and control. Critics, including [Huang Wanli](/article/en/Huang_Wanli) and [Li Rui](/article/en/Li_Rui), contended that the project was too complex, with technical difficulties and silt accumulation concerns that might preclude a permanent solution. They also raised concerns about massive population resettlement and rapid water level rises, advocating for alternative approaches.

Considering national capacity, technology, and the international situation, Mao decided to postpone the Three Gorges project temporarily, choosing instead to "actively prepare and ensure full reliability" by first constructing the Gezhouba Dam as an experimental facility. Construction of the Gezhouba Dam began in 1971, achieved river closure in 1981, and was fully completed in 1988.

After the [1954 Yangtze River Floods](/article/en/1954_Yangtze_River_flood), which killed approximately 30,000–33,000 people and displaced nearly 19 million, Mao reaffirmed his vision. In 1956, following the monsoons, Mao composed the poem "[Swimming](/article/en/Swimming_(poem))" expressing his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. Progress was halted during the [Cultural Revolution](/article/en/Cultural_Revolution) and subsequent political instability.

### Reform Era Development (1978–1991)

Following the [Cultural Revolution](/article/en/Cultural_Revolution) and [Mao's death](/article/en/Death_of_Mao_Zedong), during China's period of [Reform and Opening Up](/article/en/Reform_and_Opening_Up), the [Communist Party](/article/en/Communist_Party_of_China) revived plans for the dam, emphasizing the need to develop hydroelectric power as part of the [Four Modernizations](/article/en/Four_Modernizations).

In 1983, the Water Resources and Electric Power Ministry submitted a project feasibility study report and began preliminary preparations. In 1984, the [State Council](/article/en/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China) approved the feasibility study. At the 1985 [Sixth National Political Consultative Conference](/article/en/Chinese_People's_Political_Consultative_Conference), numerous [CPPCC](/article/en/Chinese_People's_Political_Consultative_Conference) members, led by Academician [Zhou Peiyuan](/article/en/Zhou_Peiyuan) and [Li Rui](/article/en/Li_Rui), expressed strong opposition. The CPPCC's Economic Construction Group, led by [Sun Yueqi](/article/en/Sun_Yueqi), conducted an investigation and concluded that the project "should not be undertaken in the near term, and certainly not during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plan periods," citing concerns about investment, flood control effectiveness, silt deposition, navigation, power generation, resettlement, and safety.

From 1986 to 1988, the State Council assembled 412 professionals, divided into fourteen task groups, to comprehensively re-evaluate the project. Their conclusion was that the Three Gorges Dam was technically feasible and economically rational, with "building being better than not building, and building earlier being more advantageous than building later."

In August 1987, eight CPPCC members published an influential article titled "The Three Gorges Project Brings More Harm than Benefit and Cannot Be Imposed Through Deception and Coercion, Harming the Nation and the People," which referenced the cautionary example of the 1975 [Banqiao Dam](/article/en/Banqiao_Dam) failure that killed approximately 240,000 people. This became the most authoritative opposition statement. The eight CPPCC members included Sun Yueqi, [Lin Hua](/article/en/Lin_Hua), [Qian Jiaju](/article/en/Qian_Jiaju), [Lei Tianjue](/article/en/Lei_Tianjue), and others.

The August 1987 article sparked a wave of scholarly opposition. In November 1987, "[On the Macro-Decision Making of the Three Gorges Project](/article/en/On_the_Macro-Decision_Making_of_the_Three_Gorges_Project)" was published, with a preface by Academician Zhou Peiyuan. The most influential opposition work was "[Yangtze, Yangtze: The Three Gorges Project Controversy](/article/en/Yangtze_Yangtze:_The_Three_Gorges_Project_Controversy)," published in March 1989 by journalist [Dai Qing](/article/en/Dai_Qing). However, Dai Qing was arrested following the [June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square incident](/article/en/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989), and her book was banned, effectively suppressing opposition arguments.

### Authorization and Construction Commencement (1992–1994)

In March 1992, [Premier Li Peng](/article/en/Li_Peng) and other [State Council](/article/en/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China) leaders submitted the engineering proposal to the [Fifth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress](/article/en/National_People's_Congress) for deliberation. This was only the second major engineering proposal submitted to the [NPC](/article/en/National_People's_Congress) for review in the history of the People's Republic—the first being the [Sanmenxia hydroelectric station](/article/en/Sanmenxia_Dam) in 1955.

On April 3, 1992, the [National People's Congress](/article/en/National_People's_Congress) voted on the proposal. Of 2,633 delegates:
- 1,767 voted in favor (67.1%)
- 177 voted against
- 664 abstained
- 25 did not vote

This represented an unusually low approval rate for the NPC, where consensus and high approval rates are typical. The degree of opposition and abstention was unprecedented and widely interpreted as reflecting substantial public and expert reservations about the project. The voting results sparked controversy both domestically and internationally.

In September 1993, the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation was established as the project's legal representative and implementing entity. On December 14, 1994, [President Jiang Zemin](/article/en/Jiang_Zemin) and Premier Li Peng held a groundbreaking ceremony, formally commencing the Three Gorges project.

### Construction Phases (1994–2012)

The overall construction plan adopted a "single-level development, one-time construction, phased water impoundment, continuous resettlement" approach, divided into three phases requiring a total of approximately 17 years:

**Phase I (1993–1997): Preparatory Construction and River Diversion**
- Utilized Zhongbao Island to construct earthen and rock cofferdams
- Excavated deep foundations and built an open diversion channel
- Main river continued to discharge through temporary channels
- Temporary ship locks were constructed on the left bank
- In 1997, the open diversion channel formally opened to navigation
- November 8, 1997: River closure achieved, completing Phase I

**Phase II (1998–2003): Dam Construction and Partial Operation**
- Constructed earthen and rock cofferdams in the Yangtze River section
- Built spillway dams, left bank dams, and left bank power plants
- Permanent ship locks were constructed
- Water flowed through the open diversion channel while ships used the diversion channel or temporary locks
- November 6, 2002: Open diversion channel closure achieved; water discharge occurred only through the spillway section
- June 1, 2003: Three Gorges Dam began water impoundment
- June 10, 2003: Water level reached 135 meters; permanent ship locks began operation
- July 10, 2003: First generator came online
- November 2003: First four generators operational, completing Phase II

**Phase III (2003–2009): Completion**

- September 2009: Began test impounding to final 175-meter level
- October 26, 2010: Design-maximum reservoir level of 175 meters reached for first time
- July 4, 2012: Final generator officially handed over and connected
- 2009: Overall project completion

## Navigation Infrastructure

### Ship Locks

The Three Gorges project includes two series of ship locks (located at coordinates 30°50′12″N 111°1′10″E) to enable vessels to navigate the 113-meter height difference created by the dam. Each lock series consists of five stages arranged in a staircase configuration, with transit time of approximately 3.5–4 hours. The locks are designed to accommodate vessels with a maximum displacement of 10,000 tonnes.

**Lock Specifications:**
- Length: 280 meters (918 feet)
- Width: 35 meters (114 feet)
- Depth: 5 meters (16.4 feet)

These dimensions make the locks 30 meters (98 feet) longer than those on the [St. Lawrence Seaway](/article/en/Saint_Lawrence_Seaway), though only half as deep.

**Lock Architecture and Design:**
The locks employ a staircase design where interior gate pairs serve as both the upper gate of one chamber and the lower gate of the next. This "water staircase" configuration is efficient with water usage, though any damage to gates could render the entire flight unusable. The gates are hinged structures designed for one-directional traffic, with separate lock sets for upstream and downstream passage.

**Cargo Performance:**
- Pre-dam: Maximum capacity at Three Gorges site was 18.0 million tonnes per year
- 2004–2007: Total freight passage of 198 million tonnes (average 49.5 million per year)
- Post-operation: Freight capacity increased sixfold
- 2022: Cargo turnover reached 159.65 million tonnes, representing 6% annual increase
- Recent years: Annual cargo throughput approaches or exceeds 140 million tonnes

Shipping costs have been reduced by 25–27% compared to pre-dam conditions. Originally, total lock capacity was expected to reach 100 million tonnes annually; this target was exceeded in 2015, with the locks reaching saturation approximately 19 years earlier than expected. By 2016, a second lock construction plan costing over 40 billion yuan with a decade-long construction timeline was under consideration.

### Ship Lift

Since September 18, 2016, a vertical ship lift—a type of elevator for vessels—has operated at the site. The ship lift represents the world's largest of its kind, surpassing the [Strépy-Thieu lift](/article/en/Strépy-Thieu_boat_lift) in [Belgium](/article/en/Belgium).

**Ship Lift Specifications:**
- Vessel capacity: Up to 3,000 tonnes
- Basin dimensions: 120 meters × 18 meters × 3.5 meters (394 ft × 59 ft × 11 ft)
- Maximum lifting height: 113 meters (371 feet)
- Transit time: 30–40 minutes (compared to 3–4 hours for locks)
- Actual observed lifting time: Approximately 8–21 minutes
- Maximum lifting capacity: 15,500 tonnes including water and counterweights
- Water transported per cycle: 7,560 tonnes

**Design Challenges and Features:**
The ship lift employs a helical gear system to climb or descend a toothed rack. A primary design challenge was ensuring operation under conditions of significant water level variation: 12 meters on the downstream side and 30 meters on the upstream side.

**Development Timeline:**
- October 2007: Construction of the ship lift began
- February 2012: Four support towers reaching 189 of anticipated 195 meters
- December 2015: First trials of the lift mechanism
- July 15, 2016: First cargo vessel successfully lifted (8-minute lift time)
- September 18, 2016: First operational testing commenced with limited operations
- October 2016: Lift officially became fully operational

The ship lift was designed by Lahmeyer, a German engineering firm.

### Portage Railways

Plans exist for construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam entirely. Two short rail lines are planned, one on each side of the river:

- **Northern portage railway** (北岸翻坝铁路): 88 kilometers (55 miles) long, running from Taipingxi port facility on the northern Yangtze side upstream of the dam, via Yichang East Railway Station, to Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town downstream
- **Southern portage railway** (南岸翻坝铁路): 95 kilometers (59 miles) long, running from Maoping (upstream of the dam) via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng (on the [Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway](/article/en/Jiaozuo–Liuzhou_Railway))

Preliminary work on both railway routes began in late 2012.

## Environmental Impact

### Emissions Reduction

According to [China](/article/en/China)'s [National Development and Reform Commission](/article/en/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission), approximately 366 grams of coal produces 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity. The Three Gorges Dam's generation reduces the need for coal-fired electricity generation. From 2003 to 2007, the dam's power production equaled that of 84 million tonnes of standard coal, resulting in significant reductions in [sulfur dioxide](/article/en/Sulfur_dioxide), nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, and [greenhouse gas](/article/en/Greenhouse_gas) emissions.

The dam's annual generation of approximately 100 billion kWh prevents emissions of:
- 85.8 million tonnes of [carbon dioxide](/article/en/Carbon_dioxide)
- Millions of tonnes of particulate dust
- Approximately 1 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide
- Approximately 370,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxide

### Sediment Transport and Erosion

The dam creates two major sediment-related environmental effects:

**Upstream Sedimentation:**
The Yangtze River basin experiences significant erosion, with approximately 80% of land area actively eroding and depositing about 40 million tonnes of sediment into the river annually. The upper Yangtze sediment concentration averages 1.2 kilograms per cubic meter, totaling over 500 million tonnes yearly. Because water flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment settles in the reservoir rather than flowing downstream. Some researchers advocate a "storing clear, discharging turbid" management approach—maximizing discharge during high-sediment flood periods while storing clear dry-season water. Initial projections suggested discharge rates would increase from 30–40% to 80–100% of total after 80–100 years of operation.

**Downstream Sediment Absence:**
The reduced sediment load downstream creates three significant effects:

1. **Riverbank Vulnerability:** Some hydrologists expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to erosion and flooding due to reduced sediment binding.

2. **Shanghai Subsidence Risk:** [Shanghai](/article/en/Shanghai), located over 1,600 kilometers downstream, rests on a massive sedimentary plain. Historical silt deposition has continuously strengthened this foundation. Reduced sediment delivery increases vulnerability to inundation, potentially affecting one of the world's most economically significant cities.

3. **Aquatic Ecosystem Degradation:** Benthic sediment buildup in the reservoir causes biological damage and reduces aquatic biodiversity, while downstream areas experience loss of silt-based nutrient replenishment that historically accompanied annual floods.

### Landslides and Geological Instability

The reservoir's creation induces significant geological hazards. Water infiltration and enormous water pressure on reservoir slopes cause frequent major landslides. The Three Gorges region exhibits inherently fragile geology, and risks were identified in preliminary research.

**Landslide Incidents:**
- By the end of 2008, rockfalls totaling approximately 200 million cubic meters occurred at 132 locations
- May 2009: Two incidents in Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River involved 20,000–50,000 cubic meters of material
- First four months of 2010: 97 significant landslides recorded
- By March 2010, geological disaster treatment costs reached 12 billion yuan
- By May 2010, 132 deformations or disasters occurred following the October 2010 175-meter impoundment
- 2010: 252 geological disasters occurred; 97 bank collapses totaling 3.3 kilometers required emergency relocation of nearly 2,000 people

In 2008, authorities restricted the water level to 172.5 meters (rather than the design 175 meters) and evacuated approximately 2,000 people as emergency measures. An investigation revealed that landslides and rockfalls could potentially occur at 5,386 locations. Notably, soil erosion along the dam shore decreased 47% in 2018 compared to 1999, indicating significant improvement in geomorphological stability.

In Yunyang County, Chongqing, a sediment collapse beginning in March 2009 involved approximately 430 meters of river length and 4 million cubic meters of volume, requiring close monitoring due to concerns about sediment flow into the main waterway.

### Waste Management and Water Pollution

The dam itself catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment, particularly around [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing) and suburban areas. As of April 2007, more than 50 new treatment plants could process 1.84 million tonnes per day (approximately 65% of total need). Approximately 32 landfills were added with capacity to handle 7,664.5 tonnes of solid waste daily. This improvement accompanied reservoir creation, as over one billion tonnes of wastewater are released annually into the river, which would be swept downstream more readily without the reservoir.

However, the reservoir's creation introduced water quality problems. Water that previously flowed rapidly downstream now stagnates, becoming polluted and murky. Industrial and domestic wastewater management in upstream areas, particularly [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing) with a population exceeding 30 million, remains insufficient. According to a 2005 survey by the State Environmental Protection Administration, "70% [of treatment facilities] were completely non-operational or only occasionally operational." Many facilities do not adequately process nitrogen compounds and phosphorus, which cause water eutrophication. The October 28, 2018 [Wanzhou bus disaster](/article/en/Wanzhou_bus_disaster) illustrated severe water turbidity issues; recovery operations proved extremely difficult in heavily sediment-laden water.

### Forest Cover Changes

In 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s. However, research by the [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization](/article/en/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization) indicated that the Asia-Pacific region would gain approximately 6,000 square kilometers of forest by 2008, representing a significant change from the 13,000 square kilometers net annual forest loss characteristic of the 1990s. This change resulted largely from [China](/article/en/China)'s large-scale reforestation efforts, which accelerated after the [1998 Yangtze River floods](/article/en/1998_Yangtze_River_floods) convinced the government of the need to restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze River basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.

### Wildlife and Biodiversity

The Three Gorges region has long been recognized for exceptional biodiversity. The region is home to 6,388 plant species belonging to 238 families and 1,508 genera; of these species, 57 are endangered. Over 560 endemic terrestrial plant species face submersion, though most have distribution at higher elevations. Only two species ([Glyptostrobus](/article/en/Glyptostrobus) and [Adiantum](/article/en/Adiantum)) were endemic exclusively to the flooded zone; these have been transplanted elsewhere. Forest coverage in the region dropped from 20% in 1950 to less than 10% by 2002, adversely affecting all plant species.

**Freshwater Fish:**
The region provides habitat for hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species. The [Yangtze River](/article/en/Yangtze_River) basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for 27% of [China](/article/en/China)'s endangered freshwater fish species. Freshwater fish are particularly vulnerable to dams due to changes in water temperature, flow regime, and turbine blade injuries. Many fish species are injured while passing through hydroelectric turbines.

**Endangered Species:**

- **Chinese River Dolphin (Baiji):** The [baiji](/article/en/Baiji), or Chinese river dolphin, is now [extinct](/article/en/Extinction). While extinction likely preceded dam construction, [Chinese Government](/article/en/Government_of_China) scholars contend the Three Gorges Dam directly caused extinction of the species by eliminating remaining habitat and preventing any possibility of population recovery.

- **Siberian Crane:** Of the 3,000–4,000 remaining critically endangered [Siberian cranes](/article/en/Siberian_crane), many spend winter in wetlands that the Three Gorges Dam destroys, reducing crucial habitat for this endangered species.

- **Yangtze Sturgeon:** Populations of the [Yangtze sturgeon](/article/en/Yangtze_sturgeon) are guaranteed to be "negatively affected" by the dam through modification of breeding and migration patterns.

- **Chinese Paddlefish:** In 2022, the [Chinese paddlefish](/article/en/Chinese_paddlefish) was declared extinct, with the last confirmed sighting in 2003.

**Aquatic Vegetation:**
Abnormal multiplication of aquatic weeds and algae has been acknowledged by official [Chinese](/article/en/China) media outlet [Xinhua](/article/en/Xinhua_News_Agency), reflecting altered aquatic ecology and potential eutrophication issues.

### Terrestrial and Planetary Effects

In 2005, [NASA](/article/en/NASA) scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dam would increase [Earth](/article/en/Earth)'s moment of inertia and decrease its rotation speed, lengthening the total length of [Earth](/article/en/Earth)'s day by 0.06 microseconds and making [Earth](/article/en/Earth) slightly more round at the equator and flatter at the poles.

A 2022 study published in the journal *Open Geosciences* suggests that changes in reservoir water levels affect the gravity field in western [Sichuan](/article/en/Sichuan_Province), which in turn influences seismic activity in that region.

## Flood Control and Water Management

### Flood Prevention Capacity

An important function of the Three Gorges Dam is controlling the [Yangtze River](/article/en/Yangtze_River), which historically experienced frequent destructive floods. The river is home to millions of people, with major cities including [Wuhan](/article/en/Wuhan), [Nanjing](/article/en/Nanjing), and [Shanghai](/article/en/Shanghai) located adjacent to it. Extensive areas of farmland and [China](/article/en/China)'s most important industrial centers are situated along the river.

The reservoir's flood storage capacity of 22 cubic kilometers is designed to reduce downstream flooding frequency from once every 10 years to once every 100 years. The dam is expected to minimize impacts of even "super" floods.

The [1954 Yangtze River Floods](/article/en/1954_Yangtze_River_flood), among the most devastating in recorded history, inundated an area of 193,000 square kilometers, killed 33,167 people, and forced approximately 18.9 million to relocate. Flood waters covered [Wuhan](/article/en/Wuhan), a city of eight million, for over three months, and the Jingguang Railway was out of service for more than 100 days. That flood carried 50 cubic kilometers of water; the Three Gorges Dam could divert water above Chenglingji, leaving 30–40 cubic kilometers requiring diversion by other means.

The dam cannot protect against flooding from major tributaries downstream, including the [Xiang](/article/en/Xiang_River_(Dongting_Lake_tributary)), [Zishui](/article/en/Zi_River), [Yuanshui](/article/en/Yuan_River), [Lishui](/article/en/Li_River_(Jing_River_tributary)), [Hanshui](/article/en/Han_River_(Yangtze_tributary)), and [Gan](/article/en/Gan_River) rivers.

In 1998, significant Yangtze River flooding affected the same region as the 1954 flood. A total of 2,039 square kilometers of farmland were flooded, affecting more than 2.3 million people, killing 1,526, and causing billions of dollars in damage.

In August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. During this event, the dam limited water flow to less than 40,000 cubic meters per second, raising the upstream water level from 145.13 meters on August 1 to 152.88 meters on August 8. The dam captured 4.27 cubic kilometers of flood water and reduced river flow by as much as 15,000 cubic meters per second.

During the [2020 China flooding](/article/en/2020_China_flooding) in July 2010, inflows at the Three Gorges Dam reached a peak of 70,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the peak inflow during the 1998 Yangtze River floods. The dam's reservoir rose nearly 3 meters in 24 hours and reduced outflow to 40,000 cubic meters per second, preventing significant impact on the middle and lower river.

### Water Resource Allocation and Drought Prevention

The reservoir stores water during high-precipitation periods and releases it during dry seasons, providing drought prevention benefits. The dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season between December and March annually, increasing downstream river flow rate and providing fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage while improving shipping conditions. The water level upstream drops from 175 to 145 meters in preparation for the rainy season, though this drawdown itself creates risks due to accelerated erosion during water level changes.

Since 2008, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an additional 11 cubic kilometers of fresh water to downstream cities and farms during dry seasons. In 2011, when the Yangtze River basin experienced a historic 50-year drought, the Three Gorges Dam released stored water, raising downstream water levels significantly and contributing to drought prevention measures.

The water released from the Three Gorges also powers the downstream [Gezhouba Dam](/article/en/Gezhouba_Dam), which is integrated into a cascade-regulated power system.

## Displacement and Resettlement

### Scale and Scope of Relocation

The construction of the Three Gorges Dam required one of the largest population resettlements in human history. During planning, it was estimated that 13 cities, 140 towns, and 1,350 villages would be partially or completely flooded, affecting approximately 1.5% of [Hubei](/article/en/Hubei_Province) province's 60.3 million population and approximately 0.55% of [Chongqing Municipality](/article/en/Chongqing)'s 31.44 million population.

Estimates of total displaced persons range from 1.13 million to 1.4 million, though some sources cite higher figures approaching 1.8 million when including secondary relocations and population growth during the construction period. The most commonly cited figure is approximately 1.24–1.27 million people relocated by June 2008, with the relocation process concluding by July 2008. Some 2007 reports claimed that [Chongqing Municipality](/article/en/Chongqing) would encourage an additional four million people to relocate from the dam region to urban areas by 2020, though municipal government officials asserted this relocation was driven by urbanization rather than being a direct result of the dam project.

### Resettlement Pattern and Living Conditions

The resettlement followed the principle of "moving within the same region" in most cases. Many urban residents relocated to new neighborhoods in nearby areas, with hastily constructed apartment buildings replacing traditional small houses. Approximately 60% of relocated persons were farmers who moved to newly developed farmland created by clearing mountainous areas.

However, the Three Gorges region's inherently challenging terrain meant that agriculturally suitable land had been exhausted. Farmers were forced to develop agriculture on steep slopes, causing massive increases in sediment runoff and frequent landslides. As a result, relocation to distant regions rather than within the same local area was increasingly promoted. Canadian photographer [Edward Burtynsky](/article/en/Edward_Burtynsky) documented the impact from 2002 to 2005, focusing on areas like [Wanzhou](/article/en/Wanzhou). Other photographers recording the changes included [Muge](/article/en/Muge) (Chengdu-based), Zeng Nian (Paris-based, originally from [Jiangsu](/article/en/Jiangsu)), and [Nadav Kander](/article/en/Nadav_Kander) (Israeli).

Living conditions deteriorated for many relocated residents. Hundreds of thousands could not find employment, with the older generation particularly affected, though younger generations benefited from educational and career opportunities in large cities with modern companies and schools. In Wanzhou, urban unemployment reached 8.1%, with 21.9% relying on welfare. Pre-urban districts showed 8.95% unemployment, approximately 50% of the national per-capita GDP.

Many relocated persons received inadequate compensation, becoming a significant social problem. In 2002, an incident occurred in which residents from resettlement areas demanding return were arrested. By June 2008, approximately 300,000 additional people were scheduled for relocation. Resettlement costs amounted to approximately 68.557 billion yuan (about one-third of the entire construction budget).

### Geographic Distribution of Relocated Persons

Major urban areas submerged included:
- **In [Hubei](/article/en/Hubei_Province):** City centers of [Zigui County](/article/en/Zigui_County), [Xingshan County](/article/en/Xingshan_County), and parts of [Badong County](/article/en/Badong_County)
- **In [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing):** City centers of [Wushan County](/article/en/Wushan_County), [Fengjie County](/article/en/Fengjie_County), [Kai County](/article/en/Kai_County), and [Fengdu County](/article/en/Fengdu_County)
- **In [Sichuan](/article/en/Sichuan_Province):** Much of [Wanxian City](/article/en/Wanzhou) (now [Wanzhou District](/article/en/Wanzhou_District), [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing)), a mid-sized city with several hundred thousand residents, and [Fuling District](/article/en/Fuling_District)

Approximately 140,000 relocated persons were moved to distant provinces: [Shanghai](/article/en/Shanghai), [Jiangsu](/article/en/Jiangsu), [Zhejiang](/article/en/Zhejiang), [Anhui](/article/en/Anhui), [Fujian](/article/en/Fujian), [Jiangxi](/article/en/Jiangxi), [Shandong](/article/en/Shandong), [Hunan](/article/en/Hunan), [Guangdong](/article/en/Guangdong), and others. In submerged urban districts, new cities were constructed on adjacent slopes and mountain peaks, with many residents relocating to these new areas.

### March 1997 Chongqing Reunification

In March 1997, the [Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress](/article/en/National_People's_Congress) approved restoration of [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing) as a direct-controlled municipality (after decades as part of [Sichuan](/article/en/Sichuan_Province)), primarily to manage the massive resettlement population. [Chongqing](/article/en/Chongqing) assumed 85% of the project's resettlement population, making it the primary receiving municipality for displaced residents.

## Cultural Heritage and Archaeological Impact

### Salvage Operations

The area scheduled to be flooded contained locations with significant cultural and historical importance. The [State Council](/article/en/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China) authorized a ¥505 million archaeology salvage effort to preserve cultural heritage. Over the course of several years, archaeologists excavated 723 sites and conducted surface archaeology recovery missions at an additional 346 sites, recovering 200,000 artifacts, of which 13,000 were considered particularly historically or culturally notable.

### Museum Development and Artifact Preservation

As part of the salvage effort, the old [Chongqing City Museum](/article/en/Chongqing_City_Museum) was replaced by the [Chongqing China Sanxia Museum](/article/en/Chongqing_China_Sanxia_Museum) to house many recovered artifacts.

Recovered structures too large for museums were relocated to reconstruction districts (fu jian qu), which function as outdoor museum parks. Recovered structures placed in such parks include temples, pavilions, houses, and bridges. These reconstruction sites preserve architectural heritage while allowing public access to relocated cultural landmarks.

### Individual Site Impacts

**Permanently Submerged Sites:**
Some sites could not be moved due to location, size, or design constraints, such as hanging coffins sites high in the Shen Nong Gorge, part of the river cliffs.

**Relocated Sites:**

- **White Crane Beam (Bailian Zhu):** Located in [Fuling](/article/en/Fuling_District), this 1,600-meter natural stone ledge bore 165 historical inscriptions and 18 stone fish carvings, revealing 72 historical dry-water level records from the [Tang Dynasty](/article/en/Tang_Dynasty) to the [Qing Dynasty](/article/en/Qing_Dynasty). It became the world's first permanent underwater museum, with a transparent underwater structure allowing continued public access.

- **Zhang Huo Temple:** Honoring [General Zhang Fei](/article/en/Zhang_Fei), this temple in [Yunyang County](/article/en/Yunyang_County) underwent complete relocation 32 kilometers away in 2002–2003.

- **Stone Fortress (Shibaozhai):** Located in [Zhong County](/article/en/Zhong_County), this unique wooden high-rise historical structure became an island surrounded by raised water. A containment dyke was constructed to protect it from slope instability.

- **Han-era Stone Arches:** Including Dingfang and unnamed arches, these were relocated to higher ground at [Baigong Temple](/article/en/Baigong_Temple).

**In-Situ Protection:**

- **Baidi City:** This ancient settlement was protected in place, becoming an island accessible by enhanced transportation infrastructure that was specially constructed to maintain access and tourism.

- **Fengdu Ancient City (Ghost City):** Known for its death spirit cultural associations, this historic city sank beneath the reservoir waters.

- **Qu Yuan Temple:** This temple was completely relocated to higher ground.

- **Dachang Ancient Town:** Underwent complete relocation.

## Structural Integrity and Quality Issues

### Initial Cracks and Quality Assessment

Immediately after the reservoir was first filled, approximately 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure. However, an expert assessment group evaluated the project overall as achieving good quality. All 163,000 concrete units passed quality testing, with normal deformation remaining within design limits.

Later quality concerns emerged: during 2002 construction, dam surface cracks appeared that permitted adult hand insertion, with the deepest exceeding 2 meters. Before the 2003 impoundment, validation testing found 80 or more surface cracks. After media disclosure, public concerns about construction quality arose.

Deputy Chief Inspector Pan Jiazhen explained that these cracks, while visible, are microscopically fine (maximum 0.2 millimeter width) and pose negligible safety risk. Rather than defects indicating poor construction, these cracks represent normal technical phenomena present in all global hydroelectric dams.

In 2004, [Voice of America](/article/en/Voice_of_America) reported comments by [Tsinghua University](/article/en/Tsinghua_University) water engineering professor and [Chinese Academy of Engineering](/article/en/Chinese_Academy_of_Engineering) academician [Zhang Guangdou](/article/en/Zhang_Guangdou), who stated that Three Gorges Dam quality was compromised due to inferior Chinese construction technique, technology, and management compared to foreign standards, though he assessed the dam would not fail.

In 2019, German-based hydroelectric expert Wang Weilo published research documenting deformation and seepage, citing research indicating only 16.5 kilograms of steel per cubic meter of concrete—"worse than shoddy construction."

### Google Maps Satellite Image Deformation Controversy (2019)

In 2019, cross-strait and Hong Kong/Taiwan media reported that Google Earth satellite imagery showed apparent deformation of the Three Gorges Dam, with some claims suggesting imminent dam failure. June 2019 Twitter posts compared satellite images—one showing a straight dam and another showing twisted deformation. July 2019 sparked attention from mainland [Chinese](/article/en/China) media.

The [Three Gorges Corporation](/article/en/China_Three_Gorges_Corporation) clarified that the deformed image resulted from Google's algorithmic processing of satellite data, not direct satellite photography, which introduces image distortions. The deformed image dated from February 23, 2018; by September 2018, Google Earth's satellite image of the dam appeared normal.

[Xinhua News Agency](/article/en/Xinhua_News_Agency) reported that Three Gorges Dam deformation remains within elastic range and design parameters. Chief expert [Chen Houqun](/article/en/Chen_Houqun) noted that water-induced seasonal horizontal displacement ranges from 4.63 millimeters to −0.24 millimeters, under one centimeter and imperceptible without precision instruments like laser measurement. If visible-scale deformation occurred, the structure would have already failed catastrophically.

Additionally, the world's second-largest dam, Brazil-Paraguay's [Itaipu Dam](/article/en/Itaipu_Dam), also appears severely twisted on Google Maps, suggesting that Google satellite building imagery suffers from atmospheric, weather, and terrain correction artifacts that cause apparent distortion unrelated to actual structural integrity.

## National Security and Military Considerations

### 2004 US Department of Defense Report

A 2004 [United States Department of Defense](/article/en/United_States_Department_of_Defense) report stated: "Since Taipei cannot match Beijing's ability to field offensive systems, proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China's urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion."

In response, the [Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs](/article/en/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China) criticized the U.S. report as exhibiting a "[Cold War](/article/en/Cold_War) mentality harbouring evil intentions." [People's Liberation Army](/article/en/People's_Liberation_Army) [Lieutenant General](/article/en/Lieutenant_General) [Liu Yuan](/article/en/Liu_Yuan) cautioned that the dam would not deter war and would have "the exact opposite of the desired effect."

### Defensive Capability Assessment

[Taiwan](/article/en/Taiwan)'s defense establishment has addressed dam vulnerability claims. [Sung Chao-wen](/article/en/Sung_Chao-wen), a senior advisory committee member of the [Taiwanese Ministry of Defense](/article/en/Ministry_of_National_Defense_(Taiwan)), dismissed online comments about targeting the Three Gorges Dam with missiles as "ridiculous," arguing that:

1. The dam's high-strength reinforced concrete could withstand a small nuclear weapon
2. Any missile attack would have to penetrate multiple layers of ground and air defenses
3. Missiles causing damage would be minimal if they reached the dam at all

[Zhang Boting](/article/en/Zhang_Boting), deputy secretary-general of the [China Society for Hydropower Engineering](/article/en/China_Society_for_Hydropower_Engineering), stated that the Three Gorges Dam, designed as a concrete gravity dam, would be resistant to nuclear attacks.

### China's Nuclear Weapons Policy

Debate among [Chinese](/article/en/China) scholars and analysts regarding [China](/article/en/China)'s [no first use (NFU)](/article/en/No_first_use) nuclear weapons policy includes discussion of potential narrow exceptions for acts producing catastrophic consequences equivalent to nuclear attacks, including those targeting the Three Gorges Dam. However, supporters of the NFU policy maintain that foreign conventional attacks on such targets—intended to cause mass civilian casualties and economic losses—are highly improbable.

In case of dam failure, more than 360 million people would be in the potential flood zone, making the facility and surrounding waters patrolled by the [Chinese military](/article/en/People's_Liberation_Army) using helicopters, airships, armored vehicles, and robots for mine clearance.

## Upstream Cascade Dams

In order to maximize the Three Gorges Dam's utility and reduce sedimentation from the [Jinsha River](/article/en/Jinsha_River) (the upper course of the Yangtze), authorities are building a series of dams on the Jinsha, collectively forming a cascade system. The completed dams include:

- **[Wudongde Dam](/article/en/Wudongde_Dam):** Opened in June 2021, with an installed capacity of 10,200 MW
- **[Baihetan Dam](/article/en/Baihetan_Dam):** Became fully operational in 2022, with an installed capacity of 16,000 MW
- **[Xiluodu Dam](/article/en/Xiluodu_Dam):** Operating with an installed capacity of 12,600 MW
- **[Xiangjiaba Dam](/article/en/Xiangjiaba_Dam):** Operating with an installed capacity of 6,400 MW

The total capacity of these four dams is 45,200 MW (some sources cite 38,500 MW), almost double the Three Gorges Dam's 22,500 MW capacity. Eight additional dams are planned in the midstream of the Jinsha, and eight more upstream, creating an extensive cascade development system.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Opposition and Approval Process

Construction of the Three Gorges Dam sparked widespread controversy, both domestically within [China](/article/en/China) and internationally. During the 1985 [Sixth National Political Consultative Conference](/article/en/Chinese_People's_Political_Consultative_Conference), a panel of experts recommended delaying the project, and the [Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference](/article/en/Chinese_People's_Political_Consultative_Conference) became a center of opposition to the proposed dam.

The 1992 approval by the [National People's Congress](/article/en/National_People's_Congress) was controversial. Critics noted that:

1. The submission to the NPC appeared designed to make approval a "done deal"
2. NPC representatives, mostly non-specialists, were determining the fate of a project requiring specialized expertise
3. Representatives reported receiving asymmetric feasibility arguments
4. Some alleged government interference in deliberations

The April 3, 1992 vote result—1,767 in favor, 177 opposed, 664 abstaining, 25 not voting (67.1% approval rate)—represented the lowest approval rate in NPC history, reflecting substantial internal opposition within [China](/article/en/China)'s highest legislative body.

### International Opposition

The [World Bank](/article/en/World_Bank) refused to finance the project, doubting the dam's reliability. [Chinese](/article/en/China) writer [Dai Qing](/article/en/Dai_Qing), editor of "[Yangtze, Yangtze: The Three Gorges Project Controversy](/article/en/Yangtze_Yangtze:_The_Three_Gorges_Project_Controversy)," called the dam a "ridiculous and harmful farce that will haunt Chinese leaders." Environmental organizations worldwide have denounced the risks posed to an estimated 75 million people living downstream.

### Corruption

The Three Gorges project became notorious for corruption, with significant funds allegedly disappearing through bribery and misappropriation. By 2004, approximately 40 million yuan in embezzled funds were recovered, mostly resettlement money. Notable cases included:

- **Huang Fasiang:** [Fengdu](/article/en/Fengdu) Land Bureau Director, executed by injection in 2003 for embezzling 12.07 million yuan
- **June 29, 2007:** The Audit Office discovered 488 million yuan in cost increases from lax contract management
- **2013 Audits:** Revealed 76 criminal cases, 113 perpetrators, and 3.445 billion yuan in violations
- **March 2014:** Three Gorges Corporation leadership reshuffled amid corruption allegations
- **October 26, 2023:** Former [Hubei](/article/en/Hubei_Province) Vice Governor and Three Gorges former Chairman [Cao Guangjing](/article/en/Cao_Guangjing) tried for bribery and insider trading involving 216+ million yuan
- **May 24, 2024:** Cao Guangjing sentenced to life imprisonment

Annual bidding contracts exceeded 10 billion yuan; pre-2014, most bypassed proper procedures and were essentially predetermined. Media termed the Three Gorges project "a corruption hotbed."

Official media suggested "old tigers" were involved in corruption, while foreign media speculated connections to [Li Peng](/article/en/Li_Peng)'s family. His daughter [Li Xiaolin](/article/en/Li_Xiaolin), termed the "power queen," holds significant energy industry positions. His other daughter [Li Xiaofeng](/article/en/Li_Xiaofeng) and wife [Zhu Lin](/article/en/Zhu_Lin) reportedly purchased substantial shares of Yangtze Power Group, reaping enormous profits.

### Environmental Procedure Violations

In January 2005, the Environmental Protection Bureau listed 30 projects, including Three Gorges underground and auxiliary stations, that commenced without required environmental approval. The Three Gorges Corporation initially contested and ignored stop-work orders, creating deadlock. After [National Development and Reform Commission](/article/en/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission) mediation, the corporation apologized, halted work, paid fines, and restarted after April 2005 approval.

## Notes

This synthesis combines information from five language editions of Wikipedia (English, French, Japanese, Russian, and Chinese) covering the Three Gorges Dam. Where different language versions provided complementary information, both perspectives have been included. Some technical specifications vary slightly between sources; where significant discrepancies exist, the most commonly cited figures across multiple sources have been preferred, with alternative figures noted where relevant.

The article maintains encyclopedic neutrality while documenting both the significant achievements and legitimate controversies surrounding the project, reflecting the range of international and domestic perspectives on the Three Gorges Dam's impacts and legacy.
