# Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and using the wiki software platform MediaWiki. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has become the largest and most-read reference work in history, operated by the non-profit [Wikimedia Foundation](/article/en/Wikimedia_Foundation).

The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau combining "wiki" (a website technology that allows users to directly edit web pages through a browser, derived from the Hawaiian word for "quick") and "encyclopedia." As of 2024, Wikipedia offers approximately 60 million articles in over 330 languages and dialects, with content available under free licenses.

## Overview

Wikipedia is characterized by several core principles that distinguish it from traditional encyclopedias:

- **Free content**: All Wikipedia content is available under free licenses, primarily the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License](/article/en/Creative_Commons_license) and the [GNU Free Documentation License](/article/en/GNU_Free_Documentation_License), allowing free reuse, modification, and distribution.
- **Open editing**: Almost anyone can edit most articles without registration, though some articles may be protected to varying degrees.
- **Collaborative development**: Articles are developed through the collaborative effort of volunteers rather than expert authors or editors.
- **No commercial advertising**: Unlike most major websites, Wikipedia does not display advertisements and is funded primarily through donations.
- **Neutral point of view**: Wikipedia strives to present information from a neutral perspective, representing significant views fairly and proportionately.

As of April 2024, Wikipedia attracts more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average). Over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia each account for around 5%. The website ranks among the top ten most visited websites globally and is the only non-commercial website among the top 50 in most countries.

## History

### Background and precursors

Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but with limited success. The concept of using mechanical devices instead of printed materials to make encyclopedias more accessible can be traced back to H.G. Wells' book "World Brain" (1938) and Vannevar Bush's proposed Memex system (1945).

Early internet-based encyclopedia projects included:
- Project Gutenberg's digitization of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica (started in 1995)
- Project Galactic Guide (1991), inspired by "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
- Interpedia (1993), a plan to create an internet encyclopedia that anyone could participate in
- GNUPedia (1999), initiated by [Richard Stallman](/article/en/Richard_Stallman) but never fully developed

### Nupedia

Wikipedia began as a complementary project for [Nupedia](/article/en/Nupedia), a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of [Bomis](/article/en/Bomis), a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia.

Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. The strict seven-stage review and approval procedure for Nupedia made progress very slow, with only 12 articles completed in the first year.

### Launch and early growth

On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia. The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12 and 13, 2001, respectively. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (now referred to as Wikipedia Day) as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. The name "Wikipedia" was coined by Sanger, who later described it as "a silly name for what was at first a silly project."

Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point of view" was codified in its first few months. Initially, there were relatively few rules, and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended it to be a for-profit business.

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. On March 15, 2001, Wales announced the creation of language editions beyond English; among the first were the German-language Wikipedia (March 16, 2001), Catalan, and French. By the end of 2001, 18 language versions existed, including Simple English and Esperanto Wikipedias.

In February 2002, concerns about commercial advertising and lack of control led users of the Spanish Wikipedia to split off and create [Enciclopedia Libre](/article/en/Enciclopedia_Libre). In response, Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org. In the same month, Bomis decided to no longer employ an editor-in-chief and terminated the contract with Larry Sanger, who shortly thereafter gave up his work on both Nupedia and Wikipedia.

On June 20, 2003, Wales announced the establishment of the non-profit [Wikimedia Foundation](/article/en/Wikimedia_Foundation). He transferred the name rights (which belonged to Bomis or him personally) to the foundation and later also the servers. In September 2003, Nupedia was discontinued, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia.

### Growth and milestones

After a period of exponential growth, the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of new articles and editors appears to have peaked around early 2007. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the [Yongle Encyclopedia](/article/en/Yongle_Encyclopedia) made during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years. It reached 3 million articles in August 2009.

Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013, that average was roughly 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to "increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits." Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.

In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009, compared to just 4,900 during the same period in 2008. The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology. Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011, but claimed the number was "stable and sustainable."

A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, "The Decline of Wikipedia," questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.

#### Notable events and achievements

In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, it ranked ninth, surpassing The New York Times and Apple. This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd with around 18.3 million unique visitors.

On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the [Stop Online Piracy Act](/article/en/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) (SOPA) and the [PROTECT IP Act](/article/en/PROTECT_IP_Act) (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours. More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.

On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it "had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013." Varma added, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users."

In January 2013, asteroid [274301 Wikipedia](/article/en/274301_Wikipedia) was named after Wikipedia. In October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the [Wikipedia Monument](/article/en/Wikipedia_Monument) in Słubice, Poland. In July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as [Print Wikipedia](/article/en/Print_Wikipedia). In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.

On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called "Vector 2022." It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool. The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.

## Content policies and guidelines

According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability," which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.

Among Wikipedia editors, the core content policies are often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced. Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.

### Five pillars

The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the "Five pillars":

1. **Wikipedia is an encyclopedia**: It combines elements of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. Wikipedia is not a collection of primary source documents, a dictionary, a newspaper, or a platform for advertising.

2. **Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view**: Articles must represent all significant viewpoints fairly, proportionately, and without bias. Editors should avoid stating opinions as facts, giving undue weight to a particular view, or presenting a false balance where minority viewpoints are given prominence.

3. **Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute**: Articles are published under free licenses that ensure anyone can reuse the content, as long as the same freedom is granted to others.

4. **Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility**: Participants should behave in a collaborative and courteous manner, avoiding personal attacks, generalized insults, and treating others with the assumption of good faith.

5. **Wikipedia has no firm rules**: While Wikipedia has policies and guidelines, they are not carved in stone and their interpretation may evolve over time. The principles and spirit of Wikipedia's rules matter more than their literal wording.

## Technical and operational structure

### Software and hardware

Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system. By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia. In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France. In 2024, a caching data center was opened in São Paulo, the first of its kind in South America. As of November 2024, caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, Marseille, and São Paulo.

The operation of Wikipedia depends on [MediaWiki](/article/en/MediaWiki), a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system (now using MariaDB since 2013). The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.

Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.

Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene extension was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch. In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use. It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy." The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.

As of 2021, page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server. Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.

### Automated editing

Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. This bot also contributed significantly to the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias, making them among the largest Wikipedias despite having relatively few speakers of these languages.

Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.

## Governance

Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.

### Community structure

Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated "talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike, although not always with entirely negative connotations. Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as "anti-elitism."

Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked there. Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization."

In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits." This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.

According to research by Sorin Adam Matei and Brian Britt covering the period from 2001 to 2010, about 80% of Wikipedia's content was created by approximately 1% of its participants. The researchers noted: "The agenda is formed by these people, and they are driven by a sense of mission, much like political or religious movements." While the leading group in the community changes periodically, this ratio remains consistent.

The English Wikipedia has over 49 million registered editors, though only about 113,000 are active (defined as having made one or more edits in the past 30 days). Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references."

### Administrators

Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for "adminship," which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.

By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.

Wikipedia has increasingly delegated some administrative functions to bots, such as when granting privileges to human editors. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors.

### Dispute resolution

Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a "request for comment." However, editors have the discretion to close (and delist) the discussion early or late. If the result of a discussion is not obvious, a closer—an uninvolved editor usually in good standing—may render a verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of arguers on each side. Wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as "!vote"s, in which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced "not."

Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Dariusz Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field. Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers. A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.

### Arbitration Committee

The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.

Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.

## Community demographics and diversity

Several studies have shown that most volunteer Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior." Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.

A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site." A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content."

In a 2008 book about Wikipedia, Oded Nov identified eight motives for contributing to Wikipedia: protective (reducing negative feelings), values (concern for others), career (job opportunities), social (relationships), understanding (intellectual challenge), enhancement (positive self-view), fun (enjoyment), and ideology (belief in the concept). A 2016 study found that the top reasons for editing were: ideology, values, understanding, and protective motives.

## Reliability and credibility

### Academic studies of reliability

As with any user-generated content, the reliability of information on Wikipedia can vary. A 2005 study published in Nature compared 42 science articles from Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica and found similar levels of accuracy. Nature reported that its study "suggests that such high-profile examples are the exception rather than the rule" and acknowledged that "Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries." Encyclopedia Britannica disputed these findings, but Nature upheld its assessment.

Journalist Pierre Assouline and linguist Alain Rey pointed out that Wikipedia lacks the "hierarchization of knowledge" necessary for an encyclopedia, noting examples such as TV show articles being longer than those about important historical figures. In 2014, according to a study by Campbell University, nine out of ten Wikipedia entries related to diseases contained factual errors.

Various reviews and assessments of Wikipedia's reliability have produced different results, with some finding it comparable to traditional reference works on certain topics while noting deficiencies in others. Academic institutions often discourage students from citing Wikipedia directly in academic work, instead encouraging them to use it as a starting point to find more authoritative sources.

### Common criticisms

Critics and analysts have questioned and inquired about Wikipedia's credibility and accuracy for several reasons:

1. **Anyone can edit**: Since any user can make changes to the encyclopedia's content, there is an increased likelihood that anonymous or registered users may add incorrect or unverified information.

2. **Vandalism**: Vandals may delete sections of articles or add personal comments or biased opinions, especially on political and religious topics.

3. **Neutrality concerns**: There are concerns about the neutrality of articles in Wikipedia and the accuracy of the information contained in these articles.

4. **Systemic bias**: Wikipedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).

5. **Content quality inconsistency**: The quality of articles can vary significantly, with some being comprehensive and well-sourced while others are incomplete or inadequately referenced.

To counter these issues, Wikipedia has established policies and guidelines that users must follow when editing content. These include requirements for verifiability, neutral point of view, and no original research. The community also employs various methods to detect and revert vandalism and improve article quality.

### Improvements over time

While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events. A 2023 study that qualitatively examined the development of the English-language Wikipedia concluded that it was a dubious source at the beginning but subsequently became increasingly reliable. Through a reinterpretation of the neutral point of view policy and changes in authorship, Wikipedia has gradually become a platform that proactively identifies fringe opinions and refutes them.

## Content access and distribution

### Licensing

When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.

In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.

The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

### Methods of access

Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.

Thousands of "mirror sites" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset) and DuckDuckGo.

Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles. The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles, the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles, and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles. Additionally, "Wikipedia for Schools," the Wikipedia series of CDs/DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.

There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.

The website [DBpedia](/article/en/DBpedia), begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the [Wikidata](/article/en/Wikidata) project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF. As of February 2023, it has over 101 million items. [WikiReader](/article/en/WikiReader) is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.

### Mobile access

Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more." In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile," out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.

Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.

The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access. It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.

Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years, and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.

### Censorship

Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015. This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult. Other countries that have blocked Wikipedia at various times include Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey.

On April 29, 2017, the Turkish government blocked access to all editions of Wikipedia. After more than two years of block, on January 15, 2020, access was restored in Turkey.

In certain cases, Wikipedia has also blocked users from certain organizations. On May 28, 2009, the English Wikipedia prevailed against Scientology, prohibiting the organization from making article changes. In 2014, the English Wikipedia repeatedly blocked access to its website for employees of the American House of Representatives who had made arbitrary changes to articles.

## Cultural influence

### Trusted source to combat fake news

In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post, stated, "YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, "Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet." In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.

### Readership

In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors." However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.

According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011," the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. As of February 2023, Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.

### Academic and media recognition

Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act. The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.

In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide. On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day." An October 2007 Reuters article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol," reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.

In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as "one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having "since colonized the web for television's values." For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers "endangered" due to the "gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment."

A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth."

### Awards

Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004. The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category.

In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in response to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?"

In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.

In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation. Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.

### Satire

Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on." Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence," a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion, as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today."

In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.

"My Number One Doctor," a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.

In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia," in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia." In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.

On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?" The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.

In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title "Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.

## Sister projects – Wikimedia

Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include:

- [Wiktionary](/article/en/Wiktionary): A dictionary project launched in December 2002
- [Wikiquote](/article/en/Wikiquote): A collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched
- [Wikibooks](/article/en/Wikibooks): A collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts
- [Wikimedia Commons](/article/en/Wikimedia_Commons): A site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia
- [Wikinews](/article/en/Wikinews): A platform for collaborative journalism
- [Wikiversity](/article/en/Wikiversity): A project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities
- [Wikispecies](/article/en/Wikispecies): A catalog of all species (not open for public editing)
- [Wikivoyage](/article/en/Wikivoyage): An editable travel guide (launched 2012)
- [Wikidata](/article/en/Wikidata): An editable knowledge base (launched 2012)

## Impact on publishing and research

The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay "The amorality of Web 2.0" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time." Carr wrote, "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the "wisdom of crowds" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.

Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping "far more sharply." Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?"

Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification," and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation. Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.

In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms "followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)." The study was updated in 2019.

In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day," and had "never caught it out." He described it as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence," with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.

A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used in Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.

In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.

## Related projects

Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.

Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2), with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE). One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.

Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.
