# Kosovo National Football Team

The Kosovo national football team (Albanian: Kombëtarja e futbollit të Kosovës; Serbian: Фудбалска репрезентација Косова, romanized: Fudbalska reprezentacija Kosova) represents [Kosovo](/article/en/Kosovo) in men's international football. The team is controlled by the [Football Federation of Kosovo](/article/en/Football_Federation_of_Kosovo) (FFK), the governing body for football in Kosovo, and has been a member of [UEFA](/article/en/UEFA) since May 3, 2016, and [FIFA](/article/en/FIFA) since May 13, 2016.

## History

### Early History and Yugoslav Era (1942-1991)

Kosovo's first documented football match was played on November 29, 1942, as part of the celebrations for the 30th Anniversary of the [Independence of Albania](/article/en/Independence_of_Albania). Kosovo faced [Tirana](/article/en/KF_Tirana) in this friendly match, which ended in a 2–0 away defeat. The starting lineup included Mustafa Daci (GK), Ballanca, Ahmet Zaimi, Mazllum Xërxa, Veseli, Hajdar Hamza, Nebil Dylatahu, Ramadan Vraniqi, Dobrica Barbaroga, Bajrami, and Henci (from the English version).

During the [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](/article/en/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia) period, on November 8, 1967, Kosovo played a friendly match against Yugoslavia as an autonomous province. The match ended in a 3–3 home draw with a starting lineup that featured a mix of Albanian and Serbian players: Milosavlević, Stevanović, Mušikić, Abrashi, S. Džukić, V. Džukić, Brovina, Hatibi, Radović, Prekazi, and Pindović. For Yugoslavia, this match served as preparation for the [UEFA Euro 1968](/article/en/UEFA_Euro_1968) qualifying match against Albania (from the English version).

During this period, many players from Kosovo represented the [Yugoslavia national football team](/article/en/Yugoslavia_national_football_team) in international competitions. Notable examples include [Fadil Vokrri](/article/en/Fadil_Vokrri) and [Stevan Stojanović](/article/en/Stevan_Stojanović). Three other footballers from Kosovo—[Fahrudin Jusufi](/article/en/Fahrudin_Jusufi), [Milutin Šoškić](/article/en/Milutin_Šoškić), and [Vladimir Durković](/article/en/Vladimir_Durković)—were part of the Yugoslav team that won the gold medal at the [1960 Summer Olympics](/article/en/Football_at_the_1960_Summer_Olympics) and silver medal at the [1960 European Nations' Cup](/article/en/1960_European_Nations%27_Cup) (from the English version).

### After Breakup of Yugoslavia (1992-2007)

On January 20, 1993, the Football Federation of Kosovo signed a cooperation protocol with the [Albanian Football Association](/article/en/Albanian_Football_Federation). As part of this agreement, a friendly match between Albania and Kosovo was arranged for February 14, 1993, which was Kosovo's first match following the breakup of Yugoslavia. This match ended with a 3–1 defeat for Kosovo, with a starting lineup consisting of Ahmet Beselica (GK), Ardian Kozniku, Bardhec Seferi, Fadil Berisha, Gani Llapashtica, Genc Hoxha, Isa Sadriu, Kushtrim Munishi, Muharrem Sahiti, Sadullah Ajeti, and Selajdin Jerliu (from the English and Russian versions).

According to the Albanian language version, the team was formed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia and played several friendly matches, mainly against club teams, though some were against national teams of other countries.

### Post-Kosovo War Period (2002-2010)

On September 7, 2002, Kosovo played its first friendly match after the [Kosovo War](/article/en/Kosovo_War), facing Albania again. The match ended with a 1–0 home defeat for Kosovo. The starting lineup included Ahmet Beselica (GK), Ardian Kozniku, Arsim Abazi, Besnik Kollari, Fadil Ademi, Faruk Statovci, Ismet Munishi, Mehmet Dragusha, Sunaj Keqi, Xhevdet Llumnica, and Zenun Selimi (from the English version).

One of the most significant international matches during this period was a 1–0 win over [Saudi Arabia](/article/en/Saudi_Arabia_national_football_team) played on June 15, 2007. It was the first time Kosovo played against a team that had participated in the FIFA World Cup. The winning goal was scored by Kristian Nushi from a penalty kick in the 84th minute (from the English, Russian, and Turkish versions).

On April 22, 2006, Kosovo achieved their biggest win at that time, defeating [Monaco](/article/en/Monaco_national_football_team) 7–1. The team was led by former coach Muharrem Sahiti, who stated after the match: "I am very pleased with the team's work, even though we had anticipated a strong opponent. However, I want to emphasize that our players were fantastic. The fact that we will not play many international matches may have inspired the players to give it all this time" (from the Albanian version).

In 2005, Kosovo participated in the 50th Anniversary Cup in [Northern Cyprus](/article/en/Northern_Cyprus), finishing second out of three teams. They lost 1–0 against the hosts and won 4–1 against [Sápmi](/article/en/Sápmi_football_team) (from the Albanian and English versions).

After declaring independence on February 17, 2008, Kosovo played a friendly match against Albania on February 17, 2010. The game, which had a charity character with proceeds going to flood victims in Shkodër, ended in a 3–2 home defeat for Kosovo. Kosovo's starting lineup included Kushtrim Mushica (GK), Anel Rashkaj, Dukagjin Gashi, Enis Zabërgja, Fisnik Papuçi, Ilir Nallbani, Liridon Kukaj, Robert Gjeraj, Shpëtim Hasani, and Yll Hoxha (from the English version).

### Efforts for International Recognition (2008-2016)

On May 6, 2008, after its declaration of independence from Serbia, Kosovo applied for FIFA membership. On October 24, 2008, Kosovo's application was discussed at the FIFA Congress in Zurich, but was rejected. FIFA determined that Kosovo could not play friendly matches against FIFA member nations as it did not comply with Article 10 of the FIFA Statutes, which stated that "only an independent state recognized by the international community" could be admitted to FIFA (from the English and Albanian versions).

In September 2012, [Albania](/article/en/Albania_national_football_team) international [Lorik Cana](/article/en/Lorik_Cana), along with Swiss internationals [Granit Xhaka](/article/en/Granit_Xhaka), [Valon Behrami](/article/en/Valon_Behrami), and [Xherdan Shaqiri](/article/en/Xherdan_Shaqiri) (all of Kosovo Albanian origin), wrote a declaration to FIFA President [Sepp Blatter](/article/en/Sepp_Blatter), asking him to allow Kosovo to play friendly matches. The declaration was also signed by eight other Albanian footballers with roots from Kosovo: Ahmed Januzi, Alban Meha, Armend Dallku, Burim Kukeli, [Etrit Berisha](/article/en/Etrit_Berisha), [Fatmire Bajramaj](/article/en/Fatmire_Bajramaj), [Mërgim Mavraj](/article/en/Mërgim_Mavraj), and [Samir Ujkani](/article/en/Samir_Ujkani). Some players, especially Kosovo Serbs like [Milan Biševac](/article/en/Milan_Biševac) and [Miloš Krasić](/article/en/Miloš_Krasić), continued to play for Serbia (from the English version).

On February 6, 2013, FIFA decided to allow Kosovan club teams to play friendly games against clubs from countries whose national teams were FIFA members. However, it was stipulated that Kosovan clubs and teams could not display national symbols such as the Kosovan flag, emblem, etc., or play the Kosovan anthem (from the English version).

On January 13, 2014, FIFA's Emergency Committee allowed Kosovo to play international friendly matches against FIFA member associations, with the notable exception of "representative teams of countries of the former Yugoslavia." The decision also specified that Kosovo teams could not display national symbols or play national anthems (from the English and Russian versions).

### First FIFA-Sanctioned Friendly Matches (2014-2016)

Kosovo's first officially approved international friendly match was played against [Haiti](/article/en/Haiti_national_football_team) on March 5, 2014, in Mitrovica, ending in a 0–0 draw in front of approximately 17,000 spectators at the [Adem Jashari Olympic Stadium](/article/en/Adem_Jashari_Olympic_Stadium). The media described this match as historic (from the German version).

Before the match, some Kosovo players posed with guns at a shooting range, causing controversy in Serbia. On the eve of the match, some Kosovo supporters burned the flag of Serbia. This incident prompted the [Football Association of Serbia](/article/en/Football_Association_of_Serbia) to request that FIFA revoke Kosovo's right to play international friendlies (from the English and Russian versions).

After the match against Haiti, Kosovo played several more friendly matches in 2014, against [Turkey](/article/en/Turkey_national_football_team), [Senegal](/article/en/Senegal_national_football_team), [Oman](/article/en/Oman_national_football_team), [Equatorial Guinea](/article/en/Equatorial_Guinea_national_football_team), and Albania. The first win in these friendlies was against Oman (1–0), while the biggest defeat was a 6–1 loss to Turkey. This latter match also saw Albert Bunjaku score Kosovo's first goal in these FIFA-sanctioned friendlies (from the English, Russian, and Turkish versions).

### UEFA and FIFA Membership (2016)

In September 2015, at a UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Malta, Kosovo's request for admission to UEFA was scheduled for deliberation at the next Ordinary Congress in Budapest. On May 3, 2016, at the Ordinary Congress, Kosovo was accepted into UEFA after members voted 28–24 in favor of Kosovo's membership (from the English version).

Ten days later, on May 13, 2016, Kosovo was accepted into FIFA during their 66th Congress in Mexico, with 141 votes in favor and 23 against. Kosovo became FIFA's 210th member (from the English, German, and Russian versions).

The first official international match as a FIFA member was a friendly against the [Faroe Islands](/article/en/Faroe_Islands_national_football_team) on June 3, 2016, which Kosovo won 2–0 at Frankfurt's Volksbank Stadion. On July 14, 2016, the team was listed in the FIFA world rankings for the first time, entering at position 190 (from the German version).

### 2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification

Kosovo began its competitive football journey with qualification for the [2018 FIFA World Cup](/article/en/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA)). On June 9, 2016, UEFA's Emergency Panel decided that Kosovo would join [Croatia](/article/en/Croatia_national_football_team), [Finland](/article/en/Finland_national_football_team), [Iceland](/article/en/Iceland_national_football_team), [Turkey](/article/en/Turkey_national_football_team), and [Ukraine](/article/en/Ukraine_national_football_team) in Group I. The panel also ruled that [Bosnia and Herzegovina](/article/en/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_national_football_team) and [Serbia](/article/en/Serbia_national_football_team) should not play against Kosovo for security reasons (from the English version).

Kosovo made its debut in FIFA World Cup qualification on September 5, 2016, with a 1–1 away draw against Finland. Kosovo's equalizing goal was scored by [Valon Berisha](/article/en/Valon_Berisha) from a penalty kick in the 60th minute. This would be Kosovo's only point in the qualification campaign, as the team lost the remaining games and finished last in the group. The poor results led to the resignation of head coach [Albert Bunjaki](/article/en/Albert_Bunjaki) (from the English and Russian versions).

### UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020 Qualifying (2018-2020)

After the disappointing World Cup qualification campaign and Bunjaki's resignation, Muharrem Sahiti, a former Kosovo player and Bunjaki's assistant, temporarily took charge of the team. Under his guidance, Kosovo achieved a 4–3 friendly victory over [Latvia](/article/en/Latvia_national_football_team) on November 13, 2017 (from the Russian version).

On March 2, 2018, the FFK appointed [Bernard Challandes](/article/en/Bernard_Challandes) as the new head coach, signing a two-year contract. Under Challandes, Kosovo won a friendly match against [Madagascar](/article/en/Madagascar_national_football_team) (1–0) on March 24, 2018, and continued with wins against [Burkina Faso](/article/en/Burkina_Faso_national_football_team) and Albania in subsequent friendlies (from the Russian version).

Kosovo made its debut in the [UEFA Nations League](/article/en/UEFA_Nations_League) on September 7, 2018, drawing 0–0 away against [Azerbaijan](/article/en/Azerbaijan_national_football_team). Three days later, Kosovo achieved its first competitive victory with a 2–0 home win against the Faroe Islands at the newly renovated [Fadil Vokrri Stadium](/article/en/Fadil_Vokrri_Stadium) in Pristina. Kosovo performed impressively in the Nations League, finishing first in its group (League D, Group 3) with four wins and two draws, earning promotion to League C for the next edition (from the English and Russian versions).

In the [UEFA Euro 2020](/article/en/UEFA_Euro_2020) qualifying campaign, Kosovo was placed in Group A with [Bulgaria](/article/en/Bulgaria_national_football_team), the [Czech Republic](/article/en/Czech_Republic_national_football_team), [Montenegro](/article/en/Montenegro_national_football_team), and [England](/article/en/England_national_football_team). Kosovo made its debut in European Championship qualifying on March 25, 2019, with a 1–1 home draw against Bulgaria, with [Arbër Zeneli](/article/en/Arbër_Zeneli) scoring for Kosovo. On June 11, 2019, Kosovo won its first qualifying match for a major tournament by defeating Bulgaria 3–2 (from the English version).

As the dark horse of the qualification group, Kosovo created a major surprise, managing to defeat Bulgaria, Montenegro, and securing a shock home win over the Czech Republic. These results helped Kosovo take second place behind England, with an impressive run of 15 matches without defeat over nearly two years, winning 11 of those 15 matches. This streak earned the team the nickname "Brazil of the Balkans" (from the English version).

The away match against England saw Kosovo take an early lead before eventually losing 5–3, ending their long unbeaten run. In the decisive match against the Czech Republic away, which Kosovo needed to win to directly qualify for Euro 2020, Kosovo took the lead but ultimately lost 2–1, relegating them to the play-offs. Despite not qualifying directly, this campaign represented Kosovo's greatest success to date (from the English and Russian versions).

### Setbacks and Stabilization (2020-2023)

Kosovo entered the Euro 2020 play-offs through the Nations League path, where they were drawn against [North Macedonia](/article/en/North_Macedonia_national_football_team) in the semi-finals. However, Kosovo was eliminated after losing 2–1 to the Macedonians in Skopje (from the English version).

In the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Kosovo competed in League C in a group with [Greece](/article/en/Greece_national_football_team), [Moldova](/article/en/Moldova_national_football_team), and [Slovenia](/article/en/Slovenia_national_football_team). After the impressive Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, Kosovo was favored to be promoted to League B. However, the team began with a disappointing 1–1 away draw with Moldova, followed by a 2–1 home loss to Greece with a squad depleted due to the absence of key players (from the English version).

The year 2020 ended with a disappointing record of six losses, two draws, and just one victory (against Moldova in the final match of the year), which secured Kosovo's position in League C of the UEFA Nations League for another season (from the English version).

In the qualification campaign for the [2022 FIFA World Cup](/article/en/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_–_UEFA_Group_B) in Qatar, Kosovo competed in Group B alongside [Georgia](/article/en/Georgia_national_football_team), Greece, [Spain](/article/en/Spain_national_football_team), and [Sweden](/article/en/Sweden_national_football_team). Despite some competitive performances, Kosovo finished second from bottom in the group and failed to qualify. However, on September 2, 2021, Kosovo achieved their first win in World Cup qualifying with a 1–0 away victory over Georgia (from the English version).

In the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League, Kosovo showed signs of improvement. The team finished second in its League C group, registering wins against [Cyprus](/article/en/Cyprus_national_football_team), [Northern Ireland](/article/en/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team), while suffering two losses to Greece (from the English version).

During the [UEFA Euro 2024](/article/en/UEFA_Euro_2024_qualifying) qualifying campaign, Kosovo was placed in a group with [Andorra](/article/en/Andorra_national_football_team), [Belarus](/article/en/Belarus_national_football_team), [Israel](/article/en/Israel_national_football_team), [Romania](/article/en/Romania_national_football_team), and [Switzerland](/article/en/Switzerland_national_football_team). After a series of results, including multiple draws, Kosovo concluded the campaign in fourth place with 11 points, missing out on direct qualification (from the English version).

### Recent Success: 2024-2025 UEFA Nations League

In the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League, Kosovo competed in League C, alongside Cyprus, [Lithuania](/article/en/Lithuania_national_football_team), and Romania. The national team began the campaign with a home defeat to Romania but responded with several convincing victories, including two wins over Cyprus and an away win against Lithuania (from the English version).

The return match against Romania, held on November 15, 2024, in Bucharest, was abandoned and later awarded as a 3–0 forfeit loss to Kosovo. The decision came after tensions escalated during the match, involving clashes between players and fans, object-throwing, and physical altercations on the pitch, leading UEFA to end the game prematurely and issue disciplinary action (from the English version).

Kosovo finished second in the group with 13 points, securing a spot in the promotion play-offs to League B. In March 2025, Kosovo faced [Iceland](/article/en/Iceland_national_football_team) in the promotion play-offs over two legs. The first leg, played at home, ended in a 2–1 win for Kosovo, followed by a 3–1 away victory. With a 5–2 aggregate score, Kosovo achieved promotion to League B of the UEFA Nations League for the first time in its history and won the [Unofficial Football World Championships](/article/en/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships) (from the English version).

## Team Image

### Nicknames

The Kosovo national football team has been primarily known as the "Dardanët" ("Dardanians"), referring to the ancient people who inhabited the region. Throughout its history, the team has also had several other nicknames:

- "Shqipëria B" ("Albania B") — Before 2016, Kosovo and Albania frequently exchanged players, leading both teams to be nicknamed as reserve (B) teams of each other. Kosovo was called Albania B because many players joined Kosovo when they couldn't find a place in Albania's squad, while Albania was sometimes called Kosovo B due to the large number of players of Kosovo Albanian descent in its composition.

- "Ekipi i Kosovës" ("Team Kosovo") — During the 2009–10 period, this nickname was used as an alternative name to avoid possible sanctions by UEFA and FIFA against Kosovo and its opponents.

- "Brazili i Ballkanit" ("Brazil of the Balkans") — This nickname emerged during Kosovo's fifteen-match unbeaten run in the 2018–19 season, highlighting the team's attractive playing style (from the English version).

### Kits and Crest

The Kosovo kit was mostly red and black before the declaration of independence in 2008, with few changes throughout the years. After independence, the kits have been predominantly blue and yellow, reflecting the new national flag and identity (from the English and Albanian versions).

On October 5, 2016, Kosovo signed with Spanish sportswear company Kelme to a four-year contract, which was the team's first official kit supplier after gaining membership in UEFA and FIFA. On October 16, 2018, the FFK signed with Swiss company 14 Fourteen. Later, on February 23, 2022, Kosovo signed with Italian sportswear company Erreà to a three-year contract (from the English and Albanian versions).

## Rivalries

### Albania

The Kosovo-Albania rivalry is otherwise known as the "Brotherly derby" (Albanian: Derbi vëllazëror). The documented beginnings of this derby date back to World War II, specifically November 29, 1942, when they played a friendly match as part of the celebrations for the 30th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania. The match ended with a 2–0 win for Tirana.

This derby resumed 50 years after the first match, when the Football Federation of Kosovo signed a cooperation protocol with the Albanian Football Association. As part of this protocol, a friendly match was arranged between the two national teams on February 14, 1993, which ended with a 3–1 win for Albania (from the English version).

Despite being considered a derby, matches between Kosovo and Albania are generally characterized by friendship and solidarity rather than intense rivalry, given the shared ethnic Albanian heritage of many players on both teams.

### Romania

Kosovo and Romania have developed a tense football rivalry, largely due to Romania's support for Serbia's territorial integrity and its non-recognition of Kosovo's independence. The two teams have faced each other several times, with each match resulting in significant controversy (from the English version).

In a September 2023 UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match, Kosovo walked off the pitch in protest after incidents involving Romanian fans, including pro-Serbia chants and banners. The match resumed, but Kosovo's appeal for a 3–0 victory was rejected, and Romania won 2–0 (from the English version).

In their 2024–25 UEFA Nations League encounters, tensions escalated further with fights on the pitch, object-throwing, and clashes between players and fans. The final match was abandoned, and Romania was later awarded a 3–0 victory. Both teams faced fines for the incidents, and the Football Federation of Kosovo subsequently confirmed they would appeal the decision to the [Court of Arbitration for Sport](/article/en/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport) (from the English version).

## Stadium

Kosovo's primary home stadium is the [Fadil Vokrri Stadium](/article/en/Fadil_Vokrri_Stadium) in Pristina, with a capacity of 13,500, making it the second-largest national stadium in Kosovo. Kosovo's previous national stadium was the Adem Jashari Olympic Stadium, which has undergone renovation (from the English version).

During the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, Kosovo used the [Loro Boriçi Stadium](/article/en/Loro_Boriçi_Stadium) in Shkodër, Albania, as both stadiums in Pristina and Mitrovica were under renovation and did not meet UEFA standards at that time (from the English and Albanian versions).

On July 12, 2019, construction of a new Kosovo National Stadium began. Two days later, plans for this stadium were presented, showing a projected capacity of 30,000 seats. However, construction was suspended shortly after the presentation due to political issues related to the location (from the English version).
