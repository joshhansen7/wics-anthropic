## Geography

Drabiv is located in the upper reaches of the [Zolotonoshka River](/article/en/Zolotonoshka_River) (also known as Zolotonoska River), a tributary of the [Dnipro](/article/en/Dnipro), approximately 75 kilometres (47 mi) north of [Cherkasy](/article/en/Cherkasy), the regional center. The settlement is situated 12-13 kilometres (7.5 mi) from [Drabovo-Baryatynske railway station](/article/en/Drabovo-Baryatynske_railway_station). The Zolotonoshka River, described as a swampy tributary of the Dnieper, is approximately 88 km long.

## History

### Early Settlement and Cossack Era

The first written mention of Drabiv dates to 1680, when a wealthy [Cossack](/article/en/Cossack) and later [Pereyaslav](/article/en/Pereyaslav) Colonel named Ivan Myrovych (also transliterated as Ivan Mirovich) claimed lands with a small khutir (farmstead) that had long existed on the free military steppe along the Zolotonoshka River. Myrovych petitioned the [Tsar](/article/en/Tsar) for official ownership of the estate. In 1691, he received a formal deed granting him the khutir along with associated pond, forest, pastures, and hayfields.

By 1707, the khutir had expanded to consist of 7 houses. During the [Great Northern War](/article/en/Great_Northern_War), Ivan Myrovych's son, Fedir Myrovych (also known as Fyodor), sided with the [Swedes](/article/en/Sweden) along with [Hetman Mazepa](/article/en/Ivan_Mazepa). Following Sweden's defeat, [Peter I](/article/en/Peter_the_Great) issued a decree in 1718 confiscating all Myrovych family estates, including the Drabiv khutir, which were transferred to [Prince Kantakuzen](/article/en/Kantakuzen).

### 18th Century Ownership Changes

In 1738, the widow of Kantakuzen transferred Drabiv to the [Tsar's](/article/en/Tsar) treasury. In 1775, [Catherine II](/article/en/Catherine_the_Great) granted Drabiv lands into eternal and hereditary possession of [Count Pyotr Zavadovsky](/article/en/Pyotr_Zavadovsky), a prominent statesman and landowner.

### 19th Century Development

In 1843, the [Zavadovsky](/article/en/Zavadovsky_family) family sold Drabiv to [Prince A. I. Baryatinsky](/article/en/Alexander_Kazakov-Baryatinsky), whose family name became associated with the nearby railway station.

In 1848, Drabiv was granted the status of a market town (městys), becoming the volost center with approximately 4,700 residents. By the early 20th century, Drabiv had grown significantly, with 721 households and 4,089 residents. The settlement featured an [Orthodox church](/article/en/Eastern_Orthodox_Church), 12 shops, 59 windmills, 4 smithies, a one-class school of the Ministry of Public Education, a credit union, 3 annual fairs, and a flax-processing factory employing 112 workers.

The Mikhailovskaya Church was present in the village from 1786 onward.

### Soviet Period and World War II

On January 9, 1932, a district newspaper began publication in Drabiv.

During [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II), Drabiv fell under [German occupation](/article/en/German_occupation_of_Ukraine) from September 21, 1941, until 1944. Soviet forces had withdrawn from the settlement on September 21, 1941. Following the war, the village of Dunikovka was incorporated into Drabiv after 1945.

The settlement also suffered from the [Holodomor](/article/en/Holodomor) famines of 1932–1933 and the post-war famine of 1946–1947.

In 1965, Drabiv received the status of an urban-type settlement (посёлок городского типа).

In May 1995, the [Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine](/article/en/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Ukraine) approved privatization of the district agricultural chemicals service.

### Administrative Status Changes

From 1923 to July 2020, Drabiv served as the administrative center of Drabiv Raion (district). Prior to 1923 (1781-1923), it had been the center of Drabiv volost of Zolotonosha county.

On July 17-18, 2020, Drabiv Raion was abolished as part of a major administrative reform of Ukraine that reduced [Cherkasy Oblast](/article/en/Cherkasy_Oblast) to four raions. The territory of Drabiv Raion was merged into [Zolotonosha Raion](/article/en/Zolotonosha_Raion).

On November 22, 2018, the settlement became the center of the newly established Drabiv settlement hromada (community), initially including the villages of Levchenkove and Topoli. On June 12, 2020, 13 additional villages were incorporated along with the settlements Drabove-Baryatynske and Kosorisy.

On January 26, 2024, a new law entered into force abolishing the urban-type settlement status. Drabiv was reclassified as a rural settlement (селище), marking the end of its status as an urban-type settlement that had been in effect since 1965.
