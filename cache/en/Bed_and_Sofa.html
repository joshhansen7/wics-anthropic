# Bed and Sofa (Третья Мещанская)

**Bed and Sofa** (Russian: Третья Мещанская, romanized: Tretya Meshchanskaya, lit. "Third Meshchanskaya Street") is a 1927 Soviet silent film directed by [Abram Room](/article/en/Abram_Room). The film is also known by various alternative titles including "Love for Three," "Three in a Basement," "Ménage à trois," and "Love Triangle." It represents an important example of Soviet cinema during the [New Economic Policy](/article/en/New_Economic_Policy) era and is noted for its frank portrayal of sexuality, social conditions, and gender dynamics in 1920s Moscow.

## Plot

The film is set during the years of the Soviet [New Economic Policy](/article/en/New_Economic_Policy) in Moscow. Nikolai (diminutive: Kolia), who works as a stonemason at the [Bolshoi Theatre](/article/en/Bolshoi_Theatre) construction site, and his young wife Lyudmila (diminutive: Liuda) live in a cramped basement apartment on 3rd Meshchanskaya Street, a petit-bourgeois neighborhood in Moscow. Lyudmila is frustrated by their cramped living conditions and is resentful of the constant demand of household duties. She spends her days flipping through magazines, particularly [Soviet Screen](/article/en/Soviet_cinema) (Sovetskii ekran), a popular Soviet publication dedicated to cinema.

Vladimir (diminutive: Volodia), a printer, arrives in Moscow from the countryside looking for work and housing. He finds employment at the Worker's Journal printing house but struggles to find accommodation due to the severe housing shortage in the city. By chance, he meets Nikolai, his former comrade from their [Red Army](/article/en/Red_Army) days. Despite Lyudmila's initial lack of enthusiasm and the apartment's tiny size, Nikolai invites Vladimir to stay with them, having him sleep on the sofa.

The already small apartment suddenly becomes even more suffocating, which initially annoys Lyudmila. However, Vladimir quickly wins her affection through his attentive behavior, helpful manner, and the gifts he gives her. Unlike Nikolai, who is charming and good-natured but also dictatorial and self-centered, Vladimir is considerate and treats Lyudmila with kindness.

When Nikolai is sent away on a work assignment, Vladimir begins openly seducing Lyudmila. He brings change to her monotonous life by participating in household chores, taking her to the cinema, and most notably, taking her on her first airplane ride on Aviation Day (July 14). This is a significant moment as it represents the first time in the film that Lyudmila leaves the confines of the apartment. Sexual tension that had been building between them culminates in an affair.

When Nikolai returns from his trip, Vladimir reveals that he and Lyudmila are now living as husband and wife. The deceived Nikolai avoids confrontation but takes his belongings and goes to sleep at his office. Finding his new accommodation uncomfortable, he eventually returns home, where he is now relegated to sleeping on the sofa while Vladimir has assumed the role of "husband" in the bed.

Gradually, the two men rekindle their friendship, playing checkers and joking with each other. Meanwhile, Vladimir, having taken on the role of "husband," begins to behave exactly like Nikolai had before—perhaps even more authoritarian and insensitive. Lyudmila feels increasingly excluded and frustrated by this new arrangement.

As the three continue their unusual living situation, Lyudmila begins sleeping with both men at different times and eventually falls pregnant, though it is unclear who the father is. Both men deny paternity and insist that she have an abortion. They send her to a private clinic to terminate the pregnancy.

In the climactic scene, while waiting at the clinic alongside a prostitute and a very young girl, Lyudmila looks out the window and sees a baby in a carriage. This sight prompts her to make a life-changing decision: she will not abort the child and will leave Moscow altogether, taking back control of her own life.

In the final scene, Lyudmila boards a train departing from Moscow, smiling as she leans out of the window. Meanwhile, Nikolai and Vladimir, initially annoyed by her departure, realize they can return to their carefree bachelor life in their squalid basement apartment on Third Meshchanskaya Street.

## Production

The idea for the film came from an unusual source. During lunch at the film factory canteen in Potylikha, screenwriter [Viktor Shklovsky](/article/en/Viktor_Shklovsky) told Abram Room a plot for a small screenplay. Shklovsky had previously offered the same story to director [Yuri Tarich](/article/en/Yuri_Tarich), who had turned it down.

The story was inspired by an article Shklovsky found in the pages of [Komsomolskaya Pravda](/article/en/Komsomolskaya_Pravda), a Soviet newspaper. The article reported how, at a maternity hospital, two men came to see the same newborn child, as the young mother was simultaneously married to both of them. The people involved were young [Komsomol](/article/en/Komsomol) members, students at workers' faculties. They referred to their arrangement as "a love of three," claiming that Komsomol love knew no jealousy.

Abram Room recognized that the story offered great potential for actors to perform. He began writing the screenplay in Moscow but had to leave urgently for Crimea to shoot the documentary "Jews on the Land" (Евреи на земле). The director completed the screenplay during his train journey from Moscow to Sevastopol, reportedly working standing up due to the cramped conditions.

The film was shot on location in Moscow, capturing authentic scenes of daily life in the capital during the 1920s. These include construction sites with wooden scaffolding around the Bolshoi Theatre, old streets with wooden houses, churches (many of which have since disappeared), busy squares filled with pedestrians, and the airfield used for the aviation scene.

## Themes and Analysis

"Bed and Sofa" is a psychological drama that exposes the dysfunctions and contradictions of early Soviet society. It features a frank portrayal of sexual manners in the 1920s as well as the living conditions in Moscow at the time, which contrast sharply with the idealized image of Soviet life.

The film addresses several social problems of the period:

1. **Housing crisis**: The severe housing shortage in Moscow a decade after the revolution forms a central backdrop to the story and drives the initial plot development.

2. **Gender dynamics**: The film explores changing gender roles in Soviet society, particularly the position of women. Lyudmila's character arc moves from domestic confinement and dependency to self-determination.

3. **Sexual freedom**: The film depicts the sexual freedom that characterized the early revolutionary years, though ironically, Abram Room had intended the film to support the state's campaign against such freedom and against abortion on demand.

4. **Domestic life**: The film presents a critical view of domestic arrangements, showing how both men, regardless of their initial differences, ultimately treat Lyudmila as subordinate.

5. **Urban life during NEP**: The film vividly portrays everyday life in Moscow during the New Economic Policy period.

In some scholarly interpretations, the film has been analyzed for its potential homoerotic subtext. Some critics have noted that the relationship between Nikolai and Vladimir, who grow increasingly close while sharing the apartment, contains elements that can be read as one of the first symbols of homoeroticism in Soviet cinema.

## Release and Reception

"Bed and Sofa" premiered in the USSR on March 15, 1927. It was released in Germany in September of the same year under the title "Bed and Sofa." The film was also known in the West as "Three in a Basement" or "Basements of Moscow."

The film provoked fierce discussions in several Western countries due to its portrayal of loose social morality and was even temporarily banned in some places. Despite (or perhaps because of) this controversy, it was a great commercial success internationally.

### Critical Reception

National and international critics reacted strongly to the film. The press organ of the Soviet trade unions, [Trud](/article/en/Trud_(newspaper)), massively attacked the film in its issue of March 24, 1927. It claimed that filmmakers had simply adopted the principle of the "marriage of three," denounced as reprehensible, from the bourgeois French films of that time, thereby proving how little the filmmakers knew about Soviet people. "Such a life, as Room describes it, is a pure illusion, an invention. It is simply a trick that was substituted for film art."

In contrast, British film critic Paul Rotha praised the film as "an incomparable example of a purely psychological, intimate and at the same time filmic portrayal of human characters."

The German film reference work "Lexikon des Internationalen Films" stated: "A triangle story that is convincing in its character portrayal and informative with regard to Moscow's everyday life in the 1920s, which also does not omit social problems such as the housing shortage."

## Legacy and Interesting Facts

- In the film, a cover of the magazine "Soviet Screen" (issue 31, 1926), featuring an image of American actress [Mary Pickford](/article/en/Mary_Pickford), can be seen hanging on the wall of the apartment.

- Screenwriter Viktor Shklovsky was later criticized for showing tactlessness towards poet [Vladimir Mayakovsky](/article/en/Vladimir_Mayakovsky) and the [Briks](/article/en/Lilya_Brik) (Lilya and Osip Brik), whom he knew well and allegedly used as prototypes for the film's characters.

- In 2007, at the Moscow Book Festival in the Central House of Artists, a new soundtrack for the film was presented, written and performed by [Psoy Korolenko](/article/en/Psoy_Korolenko). The musician subsequently performed as a tapeur (musical accompanist) for "Bed and Sofa" on multiple occasions.

- An interesting aspect of the film is that the character names match the actual names of the actors who portrayed them (Nikolai, Vladimir, and Lyudmila).

- The film provides valuable documentary-like footage of 1920s Moscow, showing aspects of the city that have since disappeared or changed significantly.

## Soundtrack

The music that serves as accompaniment to this silent film was chosen by Rodney Sauer and Susan Hall and played by the "Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra" for one of its restored releases. As mentioned above, musician Psoy Korolenko created a new soundtrack for the film in 2007.
