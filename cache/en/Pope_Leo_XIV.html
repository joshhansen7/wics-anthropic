# Leo XIV

Leo XIV (Latin: Leo PP. XIV; born Robert Francis Prevost OSA; September 14, 1955) has been the 267th [Pope](/article/en/Pope) of the [Catholic Church](/article/en/Catholic_Church) and sovereign of the [Vatican City State](/article/en/Vatican_City_State) since May 8, 2025. He succeeded [Pope Francis](/article/en/Pope_Francis), who died in April 2025.

Leo XIV is the first pope born in the [United States](/article/en/United_States) and [North America](/article/en/North_America), the first to hold American and [Peruvian citizenship](/article/en/Peruvian_nationality_law), the first from the [Order of Saint Augustine](/article/en/Order_of_Saint_Augustine), and the second from the [Americas](/article/en/Americas) (after his predecessor Francis). He is also the second pope to be a native English speaker, after [Adrian IV](/article/en/Pope_Adrian_IV) (r. 1154–1159), who would have spoken [Middle English](/article/en/Middle_English).

Prior to his election, Prevost served as [Prior General](/article/en/Prior_General) of the Augustinian Order from 2001 to 2013, [Bishop of Chiclayo](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Chiclayo) in Peru from 2015 to 2023, and [Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Bishops) from 2023 until his election as pope. He was created a [cardinal](/article/en/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)) by Pope Francis in September 2023.

## Early life and education

### Family background and ancestry

Robert Francis Prevost was born on September 14, 1955, at [Mercy Hospital](/article/en/Mercy_Hospital_and_Medical_Center) in the [Bronzeville](/article/en/Bronzeville,_Chicago) neighborhood of [Chicago](/article/en/Chicago), Illinois, on the city's [South Side](/article/en/South_Side,_Chicago). 

His father, Louis Marius Prevost (1920-1997), was a Chicago native of French and Italian descent who grew up in [Hyde Park](/article/en/Hyde_Park,_Chicago). Louis was a [United States Navy](/article/en/United_States_Navy) veteran of [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II) who commanded an infantry landing craft in the [Normandy landings](/article/en/Normandy_landings) and later participated in [Operation Dragoon](/article/en/Operation_Dragoon) in southern France. He graduated from Central YMCA College (class of 1943) and worked as an educator and school administrator, eventually becoming superintendent of [Brookwood School District 167](/article/en/Brookwood_School_District_167) in [Glenwood, Illinois](/article/en/Glenwood,_Illinois).

His mother, Mildred Agnes Prevost (née Martínez) (1911-1990), was also born in Chicago and came from a mixed-race family of [Louisiana Creole](/article/en/Louisiana_Creole_people) descent. She earned a degree in library and information science from [DePaul University](/article/en/DePaul_University) (class of 1947) and worked as an educator and librarian, including at [Mendel Catholic High School](/article/en/Mendel_Catholic_Preparatory_High_School) in Chicago. She also served as president (1962-1963) of the Altar and Rosary Society of St. Mary's Church in Illinois.

There are some discrepancies regarding the birthplace of Leo XIV's maternal grandfather, Joseph Norval Martínez. On his daughter's birth certificate, his birthplace is declared as "from the Dominican Republic"; however, in the 1900 census, his birthplace is listed as "from Haiti," his occupation was defined as "cigar maker," and his race was determined as "African" or "black." In the 1910 and 1920 censuses, he appears as "born in Santo Domingo" and described as "of the white race." His maternal grandmother, Louise Baquiex or Baquié, was a Creole from Louisiana.

Prevost has two older brothers: Louis Martín, a military veteran who currently resides in Florida, and John Joseph, a retired Catholic school principal.

### Early life and education

Known as "Rob" to his family and "Bob" to friends as an adult, Prevost was raised in [Dolton, Illinois](/article/en/Dolton,_Illinois), a suburb bordering the far South Side of Chicago. He grew up in the parish of [St. Mary of the Assumption](/article/en/St._Mary_of_the_Assumption) in nearby [Riverdale](/article/en/Riverdale,_Illinois), where he attended the parish's eight-grade school, sang in the choir, and served as an altar boy. Prevost aspired to the priesthood from a young age and would play-act the Mass at home with his brothers.

From 1969 to 1973, Prevost attended St. Augustine Seminary High School, a minor seminary near [Saugatuck, Michigan](/article/en/Saugatuck,_Michigan); his brother John recalled how, from the end of eighth grade on, and especially after joining the Order of Saint Augustine, until their later adulthood when leave allowed them to reconnect, Prevost was hardly at home or with their family.

At the Augustinian seminary, he earned a letter of commendation for academic excellence, consistently appeared on the honor roll, served as yearbook editor-in-chief, and was secretary of the student council and a member of the [National Honor Society](/article/en/National_Honor_Society). He captained the bowling team and headed the speech and debate team. Well-liked and highly intelligent, Prevost had a reputation for helping other students as a tutor. Out of several dozen who entered the school with him, Prevost was one of only 13 students in his class to graduate.

### University education

In 1973, Prevost was planning to attend Tolentine College, an Augustinian seminary in [Olympia Fields, Illinois](/article/en/Olympia_Fields,_Illinois), but it closed that same year. He promptly enrolled in [Villanova University](/article/en/Villanova_University), an Augustinian college located near [Philadelphia](/article/en/Philadelphia), where he earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in mathematics with a specialization in philosophy in 1977. At Villanova, he took elective courses in Hebrew and Latin (which was seen as unusual because he was not majoring in theology), read the writings of [Saint Augustine](/article/en/Augustine_of_Hippo), and discussed the work of [Karl Rahner](/article/en/Karl_Rahner) with other students. Prevost also worked as a cemetery groundskeeper at Saint Denis Roman Catholic Church in [Havertown, Pennsylvania](/article/en/Havertown,_Pennsylvania), while studying at Villanova.

He returned to his father's native Hyde Park to obtain a Master of Divinity (MDiv) from [Catholic Theological Union](/article/en/Catholic_Theological_Union) in Chicago in 1982 and taught physics and math at [St. Rita of Cascia High School](/article/en/St._Rita_of_Cascia_High_School) in Chicago's [Wrightwood](/article/en/Wrightwood,_Chicago) neighborhood during his studies. 

He earned a Licentiate of Canon Law (JCL) in 1984, followed by a Doctor of Canon Law (JCD) degree with magna cum laude honors in 1987, both from the [Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas](/article/en/Pontifical_University_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas) (Angelicum) in Rome. His doctoral thesis was titled "The Role of the Local Prior in the Order of Saint Augustine." During this period, he also learned Italian. Villanova University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 2014.

## Religious life and early career (1977–1998)

### Formation and religious vows

On September 1, 1977, Prevost joined the Order of Saint Augustine as a novice, residing for one year at [Immaculate Conception Church](/article/en/Immaculate_Conception_Church_(St._Louis)) in the [Gate District](/article/en/Gate_District,_St._Louis) neighborhood of [St. Louis, Missouri](/article/en/St._Louis). In the summer of 1978, Prevost spent three months in Clinical Pastoral Education at [Abbott Northwestern Hospital](/article/en/Abbott_Northwestern_Hospital) in [Minneapolis](/article/en/Minneapolis).

He moved to Chicago, and took his first vows on September 2, 1978; he made his solemn vows on August 29, 1981. On September 10, 1981, Prevost was ordained a deacon by [Thomas Gumbleton](/article/en/Thomas_Gumbleton) at [St. Clare of Montefalco Parish](/article/en/St._Clare_of_Montefalco_Parish) in [Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan](/article/en/Grosse_Pointe_Park,_Michigan).

### Priestly ordination and early ministry

Prevost was ordained a priest in Rome, at the Church of Santa Monica degli Agostiniani by Archbishop [Jean Jadot](/article/en/Jean_Jadot) on June 19, 1982. Jadot was then serving as Pro-President of the Secretariat for Non-Christians (now the [Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Interreligious_Dialogue)).

### Missionary work in Peru

Prevost joined the Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985, serving as chancellor of the [Territorial Prelature of Chulucanas](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Territorial_Prelature_of_Chulucanas) (1985–1986) and parochial vicar of the Cathedral Parish of the Holy Family of Nazareth in Chulucanas. In 1987, after defending his doctoral thesis, he was vocation director and missions director of the Augustinian Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel in [Olympia Fields, Illinois](/article/en/Olympia_Fields,_Illinois), and worked with the faculty of the Augustinian Novitiate in [Oconomowoc, Wisconsin](/article/en/Oconomowoc,_Wisconsin), before returning to Peru in 1988.

During his time in Peru, Prevost met and appreciated the Dominican priest and theologian [Gustavo Gutiérrez](/article/en/Gustavo_Gutiérrez), a founder of [liberation theology](/article/en/Liberation_theology). He also learned and mastered the Spanish language during this period, and later acquired some knowledge of one of the [Quechua languages](/article/en/Quechua_languages).

Prevost spent a decade heading the Augustinian seminary in [Trujillo](/article/en/Trujillo,_Peru), teaching canon law in the diocesan seminary ([Colegio Seminario San Carlos y San Marcelo](/article/en/Colegio_Seminario_San_Carlos_y_San_Marcelo)), serving as prefect of studies, acting as a judge in the regional ecclesiastical court, and working in parish ministry on the city's outskirts. He proved successful in the Augustinians' efforts to recruit Peruvians for the priesthood and leadership positions in the order.

He founded [Our Lady of Monserrat parish](/article/en/Our_Lady_of_Monserrat_parish) (1992-1999) and [Our Lady, Mother of the Church chapel](/article/en/Our_Lady,_Mother_of_the_Church_chapel) (St. Rita of Cascia parish) between 1988 and 1999. He organized support for Venezuelan refugees to Peru despite discrimination against the Venezuelans.

During the [Fujimorato](/article/en/Alberto_Fujimori) era, Prevost criticized the actions of then-President [Alberto Fujimori](/article/en/Alberto_Fujimori), placing special emphasis on the victims of the Peruvian Army, especially the [Colina Group](/article/en/Grupo_Colina), during the period of terrorism in Peru, as well as on political corruption. In 2017, he criticized President [Pedro Pablo Kuczynski](/article/en/Pedro_Pablo_Kuczynski)'s decision to pardon Fujimori, and called upon Fujimori "to personally apologize for some of the great injustices that were committed". His years in Peru gave him personal knowledge of political violence and inequality; at times, as a missionary, he traveled by horse on difficult roads to reach the isolated communities in the valleys of [Lambayeque](/article/en/Lambayeque_Region). He also stood out as a defender of human rights of the population of the [Norte Chico](/article/en/Norte_Chico_(Peru)) region against the violence of the Marxist–Leninist–Maoist guerrilla organization [Shining Path](/article/en/Shining_Path).

## Leadership positions (1998–2013)

### Prior provincial (1998–2001)

In 1998, Prevost was elected Prior Provincial of the Order of St. Augustine's Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel based in Chicago, assuming the role on March 8, 1999. 

In 2000, he permitted James Ray, an Augustinian priest, to reside at St. John Stone Friary in Chicago under supervision. Ray had been suspended from public ministry since 1991 due to credible accusations that he had sexually abused minors. Prevost's placing of Ray in a friary close to St. Thomas School was the subject of reporting in 2021, prior to his appointment to the Vatican. Ray was moved to other housing in 2002 after American bishops implemented stricter rules in the [Dallas Charter](/article/en/Charter_for_the_Protection_of_Children_and_Young_People).

### Prior general (2001–2013)

Elected Prior General of the Order of Saint Augustine in 2001, Prevost served two consecutive, six-year terms until 2013. During his tenure as the global head of the Augustinian order, Prevost lived and worked in Rome, but frequently traveled around the world visiting Augustinian communities. He served as moderator of the "[Augustinianum](/article/en/Patristic_Institute_Augustinianum)" Institute and was responsible for his Order's relations with Vatican dicasteries.

It was in that capacity that in 2004, he visited [Buenos Aires](/article/en/Buenos_Aires) and met Cardinal Archbishop [Jorge Mario Bergoglio](/article/en/Pope_Francis) for the first time. Their early encounters are reported to have not gone well. Prevost later explained that at the time, he thought he would never become a bishop after Bergoglio was elected pope in 2013, but has declined to reveal what they initially disagreed upon. However, they were able to reconcile their differences before Prevost left Rome for Chicago in 2013.

During his time as Prior General, he has visited various cities and places in Spain, especially Augustinian congregations, such as [Ávila](/article/en/Ávila,_Spain), [Málaga](/article/en/Málaga), [Bilbao](/article/en/Bilbao), [León](/article/en/León,_Spain), and [Tenerife](/article/en/Tenerife).

From 2013 to 2014, Prevost served as director of formation at the Convent of St. Augustine in Chicago, and as first councilor and provincial vicar of the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel.

## Bishop of Chiclayo (2015–2023)

### Appointment and consecration

On November 3, 2014, Pope Francis appointed Prevost as the apostolic administrator of the [Diocese of Chiclayo](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Chiclayo) in northern Peru and the [titular bishop](/article/en/Titular_bishop) of [Sufar](/article/en/Sufar_(titular_see)). He took canonical possession of the See on November 7, 2014, in the presence of the then apostolic nuncio to Peru, [James Patrick Green](/article/en/James_Patrick_Green), and the College of Consultors.

He was consecrated on December 12, 2014, on the feast of [Our Lady of Guadalupe](/article/en/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe), at [St. Mary's Cathedral](/article/en/St._Mary's_Cathedral,_Chiclayo) in Chiclayo by Archbishop Green. The co-consecrators were Jesús Moliné Labarta, bishop emeritus of Chiclayo, and Salvador Piñeiro García-Calderón, metropolitan archbishop of [Ayacucho](/article/en/Ayacucho). As his episcopal motto, he chose the words "In Illo uno unum" (In Him, we are one) from St. Augustine's "Explanations of the Psalms."

On September 26, 2015, he was named Bishop of Chiclayo. As required by a 1980 pact between the Holy See and Peru, Prevost became a naturalized Peruvian citizen on August 24, 2015, before becoming bishop.

### Episcopal ministry

Prevost developed a close bond with the diocese of Chiclayo, directing a special message to them in his first message as Pope, calling them "my beloved diocese", "faithful people" and "faithful church". He was seen as being "very faithful to the Church's social doctrine" and organized relief efforts during calamities. 

On June 18, 2017, he presided over the [Corpus Christi](/article/en/Corpus_Christi) procession at Elías Aguirre Stadium amid a large crowd. Additionally, in March 2017, he expressed his support on Twitter for Catholic Church campaigns in Peru to raise charity funds in a National Collection for victims of mudslides and floods.

He also supported projects in favor of Venezuelan refugees and encouraged vocations in youth groups, giving strong support to the seminary. According to interviews done by [The Pillar](/article/en/The_Pillar_(Catholic_media)), people in the diocese described their bishop as having a "balanced" personality, a "calming presence," showing "great charity and great clarity" in doctrinal matters, and a bridge-builder with "apostolic zeal."

While bishop, he established a diocesan Commission on Integral Ecology and appointed a woman to lead it. Prevost had a private audience with Pope Francis on March 1, 2021, sparking speculation about a new role in Chicago or Rome.

From March 2018 to January 2023, he was the second vice-president of the [Peruvian Episcopal Conference](/article/en/Peruvian_Episcopal_Conference), also being part of the permanent council, as well as president of the Commission for Education and Culture. He was also a member of the economic council and a member of the leadership of [Caritas Peru](/article/en/Caritas_Peru). 

Within the PEC, he chaired the legal council. In September 2022, on behalf of the PEC, he co-authored an open letter against the government's project to establish a national day of victims of forced disappearance from the period of the civil war in Peru (1980-2000) on the public holiday of the country's patron saint, [St. Rose of Lima](/article/en/Rose_of_Lima) (August 30).

### Vatican appointments

On July 13, 2019, Prevost was appointed a member of the [Congregation for the Clergy](/article/en/Congregation_for_the_Clergy), and on April 15, 2020, he became apostolic administrator of [Callao](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Callao). He held this position until May 26, 2021, when Bishop Luis Alberto Barrera Pacheco MCCI took over the diocese.

On November 21, 2020, he joined the [Congregation for Bishops](/article/en/Congregation_for_Bishops). 

### Political positions in Peru

In November 2022, he participated in the PEC's discussions with the country's president [Pedro Castillo](/article/en/Pedro_Castillo) during the political crisis caused by Castillo's third impeachment by the Fujimorist-dominated Congress (ultimately, the PEC positively received the removal of Castillo, who was accused of attempting a coup, by Congress on December 7). In February 2023, during protests against Castillo's removal that were violently suppressed by the authorities, along with the PEC leadership, he appealed in an open letter to Congress to stop the use of violence, listen to the demands of the protesters, and accelerate elections.

Speaking to the Peruvian newspaper [La República](/article/en/La_República_(Peru)) while Bishop of Chiclayo, Prevost said: "If you are a victim of sexual abuse by a priest, report it. We reject cover-ups and secrecy; that causes a lot of harm. We have to help people who have suffered due to wrongdoing."

At the beginning of 2023, at the start of [Dina Boluarte](/article/en/Dina_Boluarte)'s government, Peru was shaken by the so-called "Peruvian social outbreak," a cycle of massive anti-government protests, civil violence, and military and police repression that left 49 civilians and 1 police officer killed and at least 10 other indirect fatalities (including a group of Haitian refugees). "The deaths in the protests cause me great sadness and pain. I asked to stay in Peru; I even made that request to the Holy Father. It was not the time to leave," expressed Robert Prevost in 2023, reaffirming his commitment to the country. That same year, he was active in social aid campaigns for those affected by the rainy season, directly participating in rescue activities through the diocese of Chiclayo.

### Abuse allegations controversy

Prevost has been accused of covering up sexual abuse during his time in Chiclayo. In 2022, alleged victims of abuse in 2007 by priests Ricardo Yesquén Paiva and Eleuterio Vásquez Gonzáles said the Diocese of Chiclayo failed to investigate their cases. The Diocese of Chiclayo stated that Prevost followed proper procedures, met with Ana María Quispe and her sisters in April 2022 to personally attend the victims, encouraged them to initiate a civil action, and initiated a canonical investigation, the results of which he sent to the [Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith). The sisters stated in 2024 that no full penal canonical investigation occurred, and an investigation by [América Televisión](/article/en/América_Televisión) concluded that the church's investigation was not thorough.

The [Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests](/article/en/Survivors_Network_of_those_Abused_by_Priests) (SNAP), an organization dedicated to collecting cases of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, accused Prevost of having covered up cases of child sexual abuse during his time as provincial of the Augustinians and, later, as Bishop of Chiclayo.

Journalist [Pedro Salinas](/article/en/Pedro_Salinas_(journalist)), who investigated and exposed crimes committed by members of the now-defunct [Sodalitium Christianae Vitae](/article/en/Sodalitium_Christianae_Vitae)—including sexual, physical, and psychological abuse—has argued that Prevost always expressed his support for the victims and was one of the most reliable clerical authorities in Peru, leading Pope Francis to select him as prefect of bishops. Salinas has written that some of the Peruvian clerics linked to the Sodalitium sought to attack and defame Prevost in retaliation for his role in the Sodalitium's dissolution by Pope Francis due to its sexual abuse scandals, as well as Prevost being near to Francis's political theology.

Faced with the SNAP accusations, Salinas—author of five books on pedophilia cases in the Sodalitium—defended him, describing SNAP's complaints as retaliation. According to Salinas, "the complaints against Prevost come from sectors linked to the 'Sodalitium of Christian Life,' with the intention of discrediting him, tarnishing his reputation, and diminishing his legitimacy in the eyes of public opinion, just when various facts related to the Sodalitium case were beginning to come to light." He also added that "Robert Prevost always took up the cause, showed solidarity with the victims, put them at the center of his actions, and was one of their main defenders against the attacks of the Sodalitium." José Enrique Escardó, one of the first whistleblowers of the Sodalitium and founder of a local survivors network, also came to Prevost's defense.

## Dicastery for Bishops and cardinalate (2023–2025)

### Appointment as prefect

By the 2020s, Pope Francis had become close to Prevost and advanced his career. On January 30, 2023, Francis appointed Prevost prefect of the [Dicastery for Bishops](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Bishops) with the title Archbishop-Bishop emeritus of Chiclayo. Prevost expressed a preference to stay in Peru, but nonetheless accepted the appointment to move to Rome. In this role, he succeeded Cardinal [Marc Ouellet](/article/en/Marc_Ouellet), who resigned due to age limitations.

At the same time, Pope Francis appointed him President of the [Pontifical Commission for Latin America](/article/en/Pontifical_Commission_for_Latin_America). He assumed both offices on April 12, 2023.

As prefect, he played a critical role in evaluating and recommending episcopal candidates worldwide, increasing his visibility within the church. These roles elevated his prominence as a papal candidate leading into the conclave.

### Additional Vatican positions

On March 4, 2023, he was appointed a member of the Section for First Evangelization and New Particular Churches of the [Dicastery for Evangelization](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Evangelization), and of the dicasteries for the [Doctrine of the Faith](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith), for the [Eastern Churches](/article/en/Dicastery_for_the_Eastern_Churches), for [Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Institutes_of_Consecrated_Life_and_Societies_of_Apostolic_Life), and for [Culture and Education](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Culture_and_Education). On June 14 of the same year, he was appointed a member of the [Dicastery for Legislative Texts](/article/en/Dicastery_for_Legislative_Texts), ad quinquennium et durante munere.

Prevost is regarded as a pragmatic diplomat. For example, he negotiated alongside Cardinal Secretary of State [Pietro Parolin](/article/en/Pietro_Parolin) between the German bishops and the Vatican when the [Synodal Path](/article/en/Synodal_Path) faced criticism in 2023.

Cardinal Prevost welcomed the procedure established in the new Curial constitution that now allows laity to participate in the selection of bishops. According to him, this did not mean, however, that the "local church must elect its shepherd, as if the vocation to be a bishop were the result of a democratic vote, an almost 'political' process."

### Elevation to cardinal

On July 9, 2023, at the end of the [Angelus](/article/en/Angelus), Pope Francis announced his creation as cardinal, and in the [consistory](/article/en/Consistory) of September 30, 2023, Francis created Prevost a cardinal with the rank of cardinal-deacon and assigned the deaconry of [Santa Monica](/article/en/Santa_Monica_alle_Quattro_Fontane), a deaconry of which he took possession on January 28, 2024.

On October 4, 2023, Francis appointed him as a member of seven additional dicasteries, and also named him to the [Pontifical Commission for the Vatican City State](/article/en/Pontifical_Commission_for_the_Vatican_City_State).

On February 6, 2025, Francis promoted Prevost to cardinal-bishop, assigning him as titular bishop of the [Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano](/article/en/Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Albano). He had planned to take possession of this see on May 12, 2025, but the death of Pope Francis on April 21, 2025, meant that he was elected pope before this could take place.

On February 11, 2025, he was appointed to the dignity and rank of Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the [Order of Malta](/article/en/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta) by Grand Master [Fra' John Dunlap](/article/en/John_T._Dunlap).

Prevost was active in the [Latin American and Caribbean Episcopal Council](/article/en/Latin_American_Episcopal_Council) and participated in the council's meetings in [Aguadilla, Puerto Rico](/article/en/Aguadilla,_Puerto_Rico), in May 2023.

## Papacy (2025–present)

### Election

The conclave began on the afternoon of May 7, 2025, following the death of Pope Francis on April 21, 2025. In pre-conclave speculation, Prevost was considered a dark horse compared to more prominent papabili, although he was noted to be an ally of Pope Francis and a possible compromise candidate. His American nationality had been regarded as a potential stumbling block to his candidacy, reflecting unease about enhancing the United States's geopolitical power. Prevost was well aware of this, explaining to a friend by text message: "I'm an American, I can't be elected". Supporters argued that he represented a "dignified middle of the road".

Prevost was elected pope on May 8, 2025, the second day of the conclave, on the fourth ballot. White smoke appeared from the [Sistine Chapel](/article/en/Sistine_Chapel) at 18:07 CEST (UTC+2), signifying to the public that a pope had been chosen. After accepting his election and adopting his papal name, Leo embraced his fellow cardinals upon exiting the Sistine Chapel.

Cardinal [Dominique Mamberti](/article/en/Dominique_Mamberti), the cardinal protodeacon, made the traditional Latin proclamation, [Habemus papam](/article/en/Habemus_papam), announcing Pope Leo XIV to the public for the first time from the central loggia of [St. Peter's Basilica](/article/en/St._Peter's_Basilica). According to Italian law enforcement, by the time of the habemus papam announcement, right before Pope Leo XIV revealed himself, there were up to 150,000 in the square.

Leo appeared wearing the traditional papal stole and [mozzetta](/article/en/Mozzetta), vestments Pope Francis did not wear upon his greeting of the world following his election. His pectoral cross was one he wore during the conclave, a gift from the Postulator General of the Augustinian Order when he became a cardinal, containing relics from Saint Augustine and his mother [Saint Monica](/article/en/Saint_Monica), among others. He then delivered his first address in Italian and Spanish. The part of the speech he delivered in Spanish was addressed, among others, to the residents of the Diocese of Chiclayo, where he was bishop from 2015 to 2023. He expressed gratitude for the legacy of Pope Francis, and imparted his first [Urbi et Orbi](/article/en/Urbi_et_Orbi) blessing in Latin.

Leo XIV is the first pope from the Order of Saint Augustine and the second pope from the Americas (after Pope Francis), and the 267th overall pope. He is a dual citizen of Peru and the United States. He is the first American pope, in the sense of being the first born in the United States. He is the second to be a native English speaker, after the English-born Adrian IV (r. 1154–1159), who would have spoken Middle English. Leo is also the first pope born after [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II) and during the [Cold War](/article/en/Cold_War), and thus the first to be born in the [Baby Boomer](/article/en/Baby_boomers) generation. While Leo is the first pope from the Order of Saint Augustine, six previous popes belonged to other orders which follow the [Augustinian Rule](/article/en/Rule_of_St._Augustine).

### Choice of papal name

The papal name "Leo" is the Latin word for "lion." In his first address to the College of Cardinals on May 10, 2025, the newly elected Pope referred in particular to [Pope Leo XIII](/article/en/Pope_Leo_XIII) (r. 1878–1903), whose encyclical [Rerum novarum](/article/en/Rerum_novarum) from 1891 established modern Catholic social teaching and promoted labor rights. According to the Holy See Press Office director Matteo Bruni, this choice is "clearly a reference to the lives of men and women, to their work – even in an age marked by artificial intelligence."

According to Cardinal [Fernando Chomalí](/article/en/Fernando_Chomalí) of Chile, Leo told him that the choice of papal name is based on his concern about the world's cultural shifts, a type of Copernican Revolution involving artificial intelligence and robotics. Chomalí said: "He was inspired by Leo XIII, who amid the Industrial Revolution wrote Rerum novarum launching an important dialogue between the church and the modern world." Leo himself explained that "the church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor."

Another inspiration was [Pope Leo I](/article/en/Pope_Leo_I) (the Great), who is considered an important teacher of faith and defender of church unity in the 5th century. Leo XIV had his relics inserted into one of his pectoral crosses.

Cardinal [Fridolin Ambongo](/article/en/Fridolin_Ambongo) revealed that the newly elected pope had initially considered taking the name [Augustine](/article/en/Pope_Augustine_I) but ultimately decided against it.

### First days of pontificate and inaugural acts

On May 9, the day after his election, Leo celebrated his first Mass as pope in the Sistine Chapel before the assembled College of Cardinals. During the Mass, he preached against the lack of faith in the world, and spoke of a church that would act as a "beacon that illuminates the dark nights of this world". He asked the cardinals for support and generally warned against loss of faith and the pursuit of power and pleasure. Media reported that Leo would take up permanent residence in the papal apartments in the [Apostolic Palace](/article/en/Apostolic_Palace) rather than in the [Domus Sanctae Marthae](/article/en/Domus_Sanctae_Marthae) where Francis lived.

On May 10, 2025, after explaining the choice of his papal name to the cardinals, he made his first trip outside the Vatican to visit the Augustinian [Shrine of Our Lady of Good Counsel](/article/en/Shrine_of_Our_Lady_of_Good_Counsel) in [Genazzano](/article/en/Genazzano), about 60 kilometers southeast of Rome, an outing that had not been previously announced by the Holy See. He was received by the bishop of the diocese, religious from the area, hundreds of faithful, and local authorities. On his return to the Vatican, he visited the [Basilica of St. Mary Major](/article/en/Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_Maggiore) and prayed at Pope Francis's tomb, placing a white rose on it.

On May 11, 2025, he celebrated mass in the Vatican grottoes at the altar next to St. Peter's tomb, and then went to pray at the tombs of his predecessors buried there. Afterward, he gave his first [Regina Caeli](/article/en/Regina_Caeli) prayer where he remembered the "immense tragedy of the Second World War," calling for a ceasefire in conflict areas such as Ukraine and Gaza and exclaiming generally, "No more wars," and also sent a message for Mother's Day in Italy, saying "a prayer for them and for those who are already in heaven" in his speech. It is estimated that about 100,000 people went to pray for the prayer in St. Peter's Square. The pope also broke protocol as he gave the prayer from the central balcony (where after being elected in the conclave he greeted his faithful for the first time) instead of from the Apostolic Palace, as previous popes had done.

During the afternoon of that same day, he reopened the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, which is where he will live during his pontificate.

On May 12, 2025, he gave his first audience in the [Paul VI Hall](/article/en/Paul_VI_Audience_Hall) before approximately 6,000 journalists from different parts of the world, where he confirmed that his first trip would be to the commemoration of the 1700th anniversary of the [Council of Nicaea](/article/en/First_Council_of_Nicaea), in Turkey; at the same event, he called for freedom for all imprisoned journalists, as well as called on journalists to "disarm words" to combat fanaticism and hatred. He gave the audience participants the traditional pontifical blessing in Latin, unlike his predecessor, who did not do so because some journalists were not of the Catholic faith or did not believe in God at all.

On May 13, 2025, an Instagram account was created with the name @pontifex, thus announcing that he will have social media, like [Benedict XVI](/article/en/Pope_Benedict_XVI) and Francis. He gained almost 13 million followers in just 72 hours. The next day, he also opened nine accounts on X, all under the username @pontifex, to publish messages in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Polish, Arabic, and Latin.

On May 14, 2025, he met with participants of the Jubilee of the Eastern Churches and called for peace, noting that "war is never inevitable," calling for peace in the East. He promised Eastern Catholics living in the diaspora protection of their traditions and identity. He praised the sense of mystery in Eastern Catholic liturgies, as well as Eastern spirituality – mystagogy, constant intercession, penance, and fasting. He also made a proposal for mediation between the parties to ongoing international conflicts and rejected the Manichaean division of people into good and evil, highlighting the fact that they are human beings.

On May 14, Leo made his first appointment of senior clergy, naming Miguel Ángel Contreras Llajaruna to be [titular bishop](/article/en/Titular_bishop) of [Babra](/article/en/Babra) and auxiliary bishop of the diocese of [Callao](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Callao) in Peru.

On May 16, 2025, he met with representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See in an audience, during which he invited diplomats to undertake joint efforts for peace. He indicated that peace, justice, and truth are the pillars of missionary activities and the diplomatic work of the Holy See.

On May 21, Pope Leo XIV held his first general audience in St. Peter's Square, in front of thousands of people, where he resumed the cycle of catechesis begun by his predecessor on the theme "Jesus Christ our hope," which will take place throughout the entire jubilee year, focusing his meditation on the parable of the sower. The pontiff also remembered Pope Francis exactly one month after his death and renewed the appeal for peace, particularly recalling the serious situation in the Gaza Strip.

### Inauguration Mass

Leo's inauguration Mass was held on May 18, 2025 (the 5th Sunday of Easter, Cantate) in St. Peter's Square. During the Mass, he received the pallium from Cardinal [Mario Zenari](/article/en/Mario_Zenari) and his Ring of the Fisherman from Cardinal [Luis Antonio Tagle](/article/en/Luis_Antonio_Tagle) before 12 representatives of the people of God, including cardinals and bishops, who vowed obedience to the new pope. For the occasion, he used the chasuble used by Pope [John Paul II](/article/en/Pope_John_Paul_II) and the ferula made for Pope [Paul VI](/article/en/Pope_Paul_VI) by [Lello Scorzelli](/article/en/Lello_Scorzelli).

Official delegations from more than 150 countries around the world attended the ceremony, and there were also 200,000 faithful, according to estimates. Before the mass, the pope traveled in the popemobile among the crowd and toured St. Peter's Square for several minutes, greeting his faithful. Concelebrating on the sagrato were 200 cardinals and 750 archbishops, bishops, and priests; 156 delegations from around the world were also present, as well as 39 ecumenical delegations from other religions, including the [Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I](/article/en/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Bartholomew_I).

In the homily, he urged "to build a new world in which peace reigns" and also called for peace in Ukraine, Gaza, and Myanmar. He also referenced "sister Christian Churches" and prayed for "a united church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world." In his address to the diplomatic corps, he offered the Vatican as a venue for negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow and also called for the unity of the church, evangelization without proselytism, and to be "a sign of unity" in "a reconciled world." He also stated that he was elected in the conclave without having "any merit." His brother Louis Prevost was also present at the mass, creating an emotional encounter between him and the pope.

### Taking possession of the papal basilicas

On May 20, 2025, two days after the inauguration of the Petrine ministry, Pope Leo XIV took possession of the [Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls](/article/en/Basilica_of_Saint_Paul_Outside_the_Walls), praying at the tomb of the apostle of the gentiles and delivering a homily focused on the "grace of the call" and on the "obedience of faith."

On May 25, 2025, he was formally installed as Bishop of Rome in a ceremony at the [Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran](/article/en/Archbasilica_of_Saint_John_Lateran). After receiving the homage of the Mayor of Rome [Roberto Gualtieri](/article/en/Roberto_Gualtieri) at the foot of the steps of the [Capitol](/article/en/Capitoline_Hill), he went to the Basilica of Saint John Lateran to take possession of the [cathedra Romana](/article/en/Cathedra); at the end of the Eucharistic celebration of installation, the Pope reached the Basilica of Saint Mary Major to pray before the icon of the [Salus populi romani](/article/en/Salus_Populi_Romani) and to visit the tomb of Pope Francis.

### Papal coat of arms and motto

The papal coat of arms is largely based on Prevost's coat of arms as bishop and later cardinal. As Pope, he has adopted some heraldic elements and the motto "in illo uno unum" (Eng. "in the one who is one, we are one," literally "in that One one"). According to journalist José García, the coat of arms represents a union of Marian and Augustinian elements and is intended to symbolize the unity of the Church.

The shield is divided diagonally left blue and silver. Field 1 contains a silver lily. This points to purity and innocence and is therefore associated with the Mother of God, Mary. Field 2 shows a burning heart pierced by the arrow of love on a book - the saintly attribute of St. Augustine and symbol of the Augustinian Order, to which the Pope belongs. It alludes to the conversion of St. Augustine. As with the coats of arms of the last two Popes, the upper part of the coat of arms is the mitre; the crossed golden and silver keys, held together by a red cord, are the symbol of papal authority. Leo XIV continues the innovation of Pope Francis: the papal coat of arms has a motto that is identical to that of the cardinal's coat of arms. Leo also draws on the basic form of Benedict XVI's coat of arms, which for the first time shows an episcopal mitre instead of the papal crown or triple crown (tiara). It is silver and bears three golden bands (the three powers of the ordained office, jurisdiction, and teaching office), which are vertically connected in the center to show their unity in the same person.

Leo's motto is taken from a sermon by [Saint Augustine](/article/en/Augustine_of_Hippo) (Enarrationes in Psalmos 127,3): "nos multi in illo uno unum," meaning approximately: "In that one (Christ), we many are one" or "In the one Christ, we are one." This Augustinian quote was shortened to "in illo uno unum," meaning approximately: "In that one (Christ) one."

Regarding the motto he chose, on May 22, 2025, during a speech given in the Clementine Hall to the general assembly of the Pontifical Mission Societies, Leo XIV said:

"That we may all be one, Christ prayed to the Father. Our motto 'In illo uno unum' reminds us precisely of the unity of the human family in Christ, Son of God and Son of Mary. While divisions torment humanity, the Church must witness to the power of the Gospel which breaks down 'the dividing wall of hostility'. The more we are united in Christ, the more we will be missionaries of his love and peace."

### Early appointments

On June 5, Leo nominated [Joseph Lin Yuntuan](/article/en/Joseph_Lin_Yuntuan) as auxiliary bishop of [Fuzhou](/article/en/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Fuzhou), which was approved by Chinese authorities on June 11 as part of a 2018 agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Holy See under Pope Francis.

On June 13, Leo set the canonization of [Carlo Acutis](/article/en/Carlo_Acutis), which had been postponed due to Pope Francis's death, on September 7, 2025.

### Use of social media

On May 13, 2025, the Pope's official social networks were reactivated after the death of Francis. Leo XIV thus continued the line of his predecessors regarding social networks. On X, he is represented with an account called @Pontifex, which is available in nine languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Polish, Arabic, and Latin. He is also present on the social media platform Instagram, where an official profile exists with the designation "@Pontifex - Pope Leo XIV."

## Positions and views

### Church policy and theological positions

Prevost's first message as pope emphasized the greeting of peace of the risen Jesus "who gave his life for God's flock", giving "an unarmed and disarming peace". Leo said he wanted to continue the kerygmatic blessing of Pope Francis: "God cares for you, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail! We are all in God's hands." The themes in his first message included Jesus as light needed by the world, becoming a missionary church through dialogue and openness, fidelity to the Gospel, walking together in synodality, working as a united church for peace and justice, closeness to the suffering, and praying to Mary. Twice he mentioned the need of not having fear, and emphasized God's help to "build bridges" for "all of us to be one people always in peace."

In his first address as pope to the cardinals, Leo declared his "complete commitment" to the ecclesial path traced by the [Second Vatican Council](/article/en/Second_Vatican_Council). He praised Pope Francis's specification of this path through [Evangelii Gaudium](/article/en/Evangelii_gaudium), the Joy of the Gospel, and highlighted six "evangelical principles", which he deems as perennial and revelatory of God's mercy: the primacy of Christ in proclamation; the missionary conversion of the entire Christian community; collegiality and synodality; attention to the sensus fidei, the capacity of the whole faithful to sense the faith, especially popular piety; loving care for the least and the rejected; and dialogue with the contemporary world.

Even before his inauguration, Pope Leo XIV met with members of the Vatican foundation [Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice](/article/en/Centesimus_Annus_Pro_Pontifice) in the Sala Clementina on May 17, 2025, and emphasized in his address the importance of the Church's social teaching as a way of reflection and dialogue. The Pope focused his core message on understanding the magisterium as an open, shared path of knowledge. He also emphasized the need for critical thinking in dealing with the digital revolution and called for the further development of the Church's social teaching through listening and dialogue in this historic time of great social transformation.

### Liturgical and ceremonial practice

During his service in Peru, Prevost was described as an "impeccable dresser" when it came to celebrating the Mass, wearing full vestments even when summer temperatures rose above 85°F in Chiclayo. In August 2024, speaking to a Chicago-area parish, Prevost stated that "liturgy needs to be beautiful to help us, to strengthen us in our faith." In his first Mass in the Sistine Chapel as pope, he chose to use a papal ferula, or ceremonial staff, made for Benedict XVI and seldom used by Francis. The mozzetta worn after his election, and Benedict's ferula signaled to some a "return to normal" in the Holy See following the Francis papacy. However, during his Inauguration Mass in St Peter's Square on May 18, 2025, Leo XIV used the ferula of Pope Paul VI which is most commonly associated with Pope John Paul II, and frequently used by Francis.

Pope Leo XIV received another pectoral cross upon his election, which he has been wearing instead of the one he wore during the conclave and his first appearance as pope. This one is silver, with relics of St. Leo the Great, St. Augustine, St. Thomas of Villanova, and Blessed [Anselmo Polanco Fontecha](/article/en/Anselmo_Polanco_Fontecha). He also chose to restore the custom of the pope himself giving archbishops the pallium, which had been altered by Francis in 2015.

### Synodality

As a cardinal, Prevost was a vocal proponent of synodality, one of Pope Francis's signature initiatives. Prevost suggested that the participation and co-responsibility of all the faithful could address the polarization in the church. In May 2023, Prevost said that episcopal leadership should prioritize faith over administration. The first priority is to "communicate the beauty of the faith, the beauty and joy of knowing Jesus." Also in May 2023, Prevost said he has faith that "the Holy Spirit is [...] pushing us towards a renewal." He stated that all the faithful are "called to the great responsibility of living what I call a new attitude," which is "to listen first of all to the Holy Spirit, to what He is asking of the Church."

Prevost is considered a supporter of the synodal principle, and in his first address as Pope, he affirmed that "we want to be a synodal church for all of you brothers and sisters (...), a church that is on the way."

In 2024, Prevost said in an interview that he had learned through the [World Synod](/article/en/Synod_on_Synodality) how many different views there are on the role of the bishop. However, in his opinion, the principle is that the bishop should not be a "little prince sitting in his kingdom," but is "authentically called to be humble; to be close to the people he serves, to walk with them, to suffer with them."

### Women in the Church

Discussing the ordination of women in October 2023, Prevost stated that the "very significant and long tradition of the church" makes it impossible to consider women as priests and that "the apostolic tradition is something that has been spelled out very clearly." By contrast, he observed that the possibility of women deacons has been the subject of two Vatican commissions, demonstrating "openness to giving consideration" to that question. He also cautioned that the ordination of women as deacons "doesn't necessarily solve a problem" and could create new issues. Commenting on Pope Francis's 2023 appointment of three women as members of the Dicastery for Bishops, which he headed, he noted that their perspectives often align with other members but can introduce valuable new viewpoints.

### Ecumenism

The [National Catholic Reporter](/article/en/National_Catholic_Reporter) stated that Leo XIV is committed to ecumenism with other Christian denominations. At his inauguration, he referenced "sister Christian Churches" and prayed for "a united church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world." Leo XIV's first international trip as pontiff will be to Turkey to celebrate the 1,700th anniversary of the [First Council of Nicaea](/article/en/First_Council_of_Nicaea) with other Christians.

### Social and political issues

Within the context of church politics and theology, Prevost has been seen as a moderate or centrist, neither liberal nor conservative. In April 2025, the Italian newspaper [la Repubblica](/article/en/La_Repubblica) stated that Prevost was seen as a "cosmopolitan and shy figure" who was "appreciated by conservatives and progressives" within the church. [Evelyn Finger](/article/en/Evelyn_Finger) on [Zeit Online](/article/en/Die_Zeit) described Leo XIV as "so far 'left', [...] so liberal, that until the very end hardly any Vatican expert believed the College of Cardinals could agree on someone like him."

On the eve of his election, the [Neue Zürcher Zeitung](/article/en/Neue_Zürcher_Zeitung) wrote that he was considered a "pragmatic man of the center and a mediator between the worlds of American Catholicism." Due to his origins, his U.S. and Peruvian citizenship, and his areas of activity in pastoral care, spiritual formation, and church administration in the United States, Peru, and Rome, he is described as a cosmopolitan or citizen of the world.

In line with the church's official positions, Prevost opposes abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage and the death penalty. In May 2025, he said that it was up to governments to build peaceful societies "above all by investing in the family, founded upon the stable union between a man and a woman."

During his time in Chiclayo, Prevost remained relatively politically neutral on national issues. However, in the midst of the Peruvian protests in 2023, he stated: "The deaths during the protests cause me great sadness and pain [...] I asked to stay in Peru; I even made that request to the Holy Father. It wasn't the time to leave." He has also expressed support for the plight of Venezuelan refugees in Peru.

With regards to climate change, Prevost has advocated for stronger church action, stating in a November 2024 seminar that "dominion over nature" should not be "tyrannical".

On geopolitics, he denounced the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](/article/en/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), describing it as "a true invasion, imperialist in nature, where Russia seeks to conquer territory for reasons of power", and in one of his first major speeches as pope, Leo called for a ceasefire in the [Gaza war](/article/en/2023_Israel–Hamas_war).

In his [Pentecost](/article/en/Pentecost) homily soon after his election as Pope, Leo criticized the "exclusionary mindset" displayed by various nationalist movements. The Holy Spirit "breaks down barriers and tears down the walls of indifference and hatred", he said. To Leo, areas advertised as "security zones" had the effect of "separating us from our neighbors" and spreading "prejudice". He proclaimed that the Church needed to "open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race."

### LGBT issues

Prevost opposed what he called "gender ideology" in Peruvian school curricula, claiming it promotes "non-existent genders." In 2012, during the papacy of Benedict XVI, he criticized popular culture's sympathy for the "homosexual lifestyle" and diverse families and same-sex adoptions.

In 2016, Prevost opposed the inclusion of "gender ideology" in Peruvian primary school curricula, stating it promotes "genders that don't exist".

Later, Prevost stated in an interview for [Catholic News Service](/article/en/Catholic_News_Service) in 2023 that regarding his 2012 statements, "many things have changed" and that it was necessary for the Church to open up and be welcoming, emphasizing Pope Francis's message of "not letting people feel excluded." He also stated that the Church's doctrine has not changed. Prevost expressed reservations about "sympathy for beliefs and practices that contradict the gospel" and neither fully supported nor rejected [Fiducia supplicans](/article/en/Fiducia_supplicans), a declaration concerning blessings for people in a same-sex relationship. He stated that national bishops' conferences should "interpret and apply such directives in their local contexts, given cultural differences."

### Communication and social media

In a May 2023 interview, Prevost emphasized the need for prudence and responsibility in the use of social media to avoid "feeding divisions and controversies" and causing "damage to the communion of the Church." This view is in line with his tendency to speak "with caution and great deliberation", as Christopher White, the Vatican correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter, described him.

### United States political involvement

Throughout his time as a bishop and as a cardinal, Prevost continued to vote in both state and federal elections in the United States, being a registered voter in [Will County, Illinois](/article/en/Will_County,_Illinois). [Illinois](/article/en/Illinois) election law does not require voters to register by political party, thus Prevost has never officially declared any affiliation to a political party.

The elections Prevost has voted in include the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, the Democratic primary for the 2010 Illinois gubernatorial election, the 2012 Republican presidential primary, the Republican primary for the 2014 Illinois gubernatorial election, the 2016 Republican presidential primary, and the 2024 United States general election.

In 2016, after [Donald Trump](/article/en/Donald_Trump)'s victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Prevost shared the opinion of Cardinal and Archbishop of Chicago, [Blase Joseph Cupich](/article/en/Blase_J._Cupich), that this reflected a great social polarization among Americans due to the feeling of a system that does not represent them (influenced by high economic disparity, disillusionment with liberal democracy, and sensitivity to the social impact of racism in the United States since the Civil War), as well as that the vote of Catholics opposed to abortion largely influenced the Republican Party's victory, but that this in turn puts at risk the unity of the Catholic Church in the United States in terms of how to promote the social doctrine of the Church, due to the desire of many bishops to address other social issues that Trumpists do not show importance for, but without also granting support to the Democratic Party for its progressive ideas contrary to the traditional values of Catholic moral theology.

On the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Prevost's former account retweeted posts critical of US immigration policies under President Donald Trump and Vice President [JD Vance](/article/en/JD_Vance). He has also expressed support for COVID-19 vaccination during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/article/en/COVID-19_pandemic) and sympathy for [George Floyd](/article/en/George_Floyd) and protesters. His X account which he used prior to his election as pope has since been deleted and he is currently using the official @Pontifex handle, inherited from Popes Francis and Benedict.

Journalist [Antonio Maestre](/article/en/Antonio_Maestre), specialized in Spain's far right, has mentioned that "ultraconservative" and Trumpist media have sought to discredit Leo XIV.

According to Archbishop of Chicago Blase Cupich, who soon after Robert Prevost's appointment to the Dicastery for Bishops in 2019 became his close collaborator, Leo XIV has a similar vision of the Church to his predecessor and was elected to continue his reforms, starting with the finances of the Roman Curia.

## Personal life

In addition to his native language of English, Leo speaks Spanish, Italian, French, and Portuguese fluently, along with some German. He can also read Latin. During his time in Peru, Leo acquired basic knowledge of one of the Quechua languages.

He has described himself as "quite the amateur tennis player". He regularly plays [Wordle](/article/en/Wordle) and [Words with Friends](/article/en/Words_with_Friends) with his brothers.

Leo is a lifelong fan of the [Chicago White Sox](/article/en/Chicago_White_Sox) of [Major League Baseball](/article/en/Major_League_Baseball), and was in attendance at [US Cellular Field](/article/en/Guaranteed_Rate_Field) (now known as Rate Field) for Game 1 of the [2005 World Series](/article/en/2005_World_Series). His support for Chicago sports also extends to the [National Football League](/article/en/National_Football_League)'s [Chicago Bears](/article/en/Chicago_Bears); JD Vance presented him with a custom Bears jersey following his papal inauguration, which Leo remarked was a "good choice". He has also shown support for [Villanova University](/article/en/Villanova_University) athletics, especially the [Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team](/article/en/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball), and the Peruvian soccer team [Alianza Lima](/article/en/Club_Alianza_Lima).

As a teenager, he enjoyed driving recreationally. Throughout his life, he has frequently preferred driving long distances for journeys where most people prefer to fly, such as from Philadelphia to Chicago, Brisbane to Sydney, and Chiclayo to Lima. He also repaired cars himself as a bishop in Chiclayo.

Leo has been reported to have "a very disciplined prayer life." During his time as bishop of Chiclayo, aside from daily Mass celebrated at 8 p.m. to ensure a clear mind, Prevost had periods of prayer at the beginning of the day and before dinner. He prayed lauds in the morning at the Cathedral and the Rosary with his priest colleagues around noon.
