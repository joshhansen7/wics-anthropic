# Gjakova

**Gjakova** (pronounced [ɟakova]; Albanian: Gjakovë; Serbian Cyrillic: Ђаковица, Đakovica, pronounced [ˈdʑakoʋitsa]; Turkish: Yakova, Altuneli) is a city in southwestern [Kosovo](/article/en/Kosovo) and the seat of the [Gjakova Municipality](/article/en/Gjakova_Municipality) and [Gjakova District](/article/en/Gjakova_District). It is the sixth-largest city in Kosovo by some accounts and among the largest by others. According to the 2024 census, the municipality of Gjakova has 78,699 inhabitants, though estimates vary significantly depending on source and methodology.

The city is located in the southwestern part of Kosovo, approximately midway between [Peja](/article/en/Peja) to the north and [Prizren](/article/en/Prizren) to the south. It lies approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) inland from the [Adriatic Sea](/article/en/Adriatic_Sea), some 208 kilometres (129 mi) northeast of [Tirana](/article/en/Tirana), 145 kilometres (90 mi) northwest of [Skopje](/article/en/Skopje), 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of [Pristina](/article/en/Pristina), 435 kilometres (270 mi) south of [Belgrade](/article/en/Belgrade), and 263 kilometres (163 mi) east of [Podgorica](/article/en/Podgorica).

Gjakova is renowned as a historic trading center that emerged as a key commercial hub during the [Ottoman Empire](/article/en/Ottoman_Empire), particularly along the route connecting [Shkodra](/article/en/Shkodra) and [Constantinople](/article/en/Constantinople). At its peak in the 17th century, Gjakova was regarded as one of the most advanced commercial centres in the Balkans, featuring thousands of houses, numerous mosques, workshops, and trading establishments.

## Etymology

The origin of the city's name is subject to multiple theories, reflecting its complex historical and cultural heritage.

The most widely accepted explanation derives the name from **Jakov** (or Jak), a little-known nobleman in the service of [Vuk Branković](/article/en/Vuk_Brankovic) (1345–1397), a medieval Serbian lord. According to this theory, Jakov founded and ruled the city, and coins bearing his name signed "Jakov" or "Iakov" have been preserved as historical evidence. The suffix "-ova" (or "-va" in Albanian: "-va"), derived from Ottoman Turkish, means "field," so "Gjakova" or "Jakovica" literally means "Jakov's field" or "Jakov's place."

An alternative **Albanian theory** traces the name to the Albanian word **gjak**, meaning "blood," though this etymology is less commonly cited by historians.

A third explanation suggests derivation from the Serbian word **đak**, meaning "pupil" or "student," though this theory has limited scholarly support.

According to local Albanian tradition, the land where the city was built was owned by an Albanian Catholic named Jakë Vula, from whom the city took its name. Ottoman documents record that Hoxa Hadum Aga convinced Jakë Vula to donate land for the construction of a mosque and library, after which the settlement began to develop around these structures.

## History

### Early History and Medieval Period

Evidence of human habitation in the Gjakova region dates back to prehistoric times. The city has been continuously settled due to its favorable geographical location at the intersection of important transversal and longitudinal trade routes, particularly the Via Zeta (connecting Shkodra to Kosovo) with the longitudinal road through the Dukagjin Plain.

Medieval historical records mention Gjakova from the 14th century, specifically from 1348, when it belonged to the nahija (administrative division) of Altun-ili, with its center in [Junik](/article/en/Junik). During the medieval Serbian period, the city was ruled by various Serbian princes until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1454.

### Ottoman Period

**Early Ottoman Era and Development**

In the comprehensive Ottoman census (defter) of 1485, Gjakova is recorded as a village with either 54 or 67 households (sources vary), with the population consisting primarily of Serbian residents and possibly two Albanian households. The settlement served as a local market center, a characteristic feature of Albanian cities during the 15th and 16th centuries.

According to [Edith Durham](/article/en/Edith_Durham), the British explorer and ethnographer, Gjakova was founded in the 15th and 16th centuries by members of the [Albanian Mërturi tribe](/article/en/Merturi), specifically by the families descended from Bitush Mërturi—the Vula and Mërtur families. The local Albanians developed it into a town during the 16th century, and the settlement has maintained an ethnic Albanian majority since its establishment.

During the early Ottoman period, Gjakova and the wider municipality were part of the Nahiya of Altun-ili. Historian Selami Pulaha notes that most villages in this nahiya, along with settlements between Gjakova and Prizren, were dominated by inhabitants with Albanian anthroponymy (naming patterns), indicating that the lands between Junik and Gjakova were inhabited by a dominant ethnic Albanian majority during the 15th century, as supported by Ottoman tax registers.

**Rise as a Commercial Center**

In the 1571 and 1591 Ottoman defters, the majority of Gjakova's inhabitants are recorded with Albanian anthroponymy, with Albanian onomastics prevailing over Slavic naming patterns. In 1638, the [Archbishop of Bar](/article/en/Archbishop_of_Bar), Gjergj Bardhi, reported that Gjakova had 320 Muslim homes, 20 Catholic homes, and 20 Orthodox homes, and recorded that the region was inhabited by Albanians and that the Albanian language was spoken there.

In 1594, the Ottoman architect [Mimar Sinan](/article/en/Mimar_Sinan) oversaw the construction of the **Hadum Mosque** (also known as Hadim Mosque or Hadum's Mosque), financed by Hadum Aga, a politically important local Albanian official. The mosque became the focal point of an expanding urban complex, with the marketplace developing nearby in what became known as the **Old Bazaar** or **Grand Bazaar** (Çarshia e Madhe).

By 1662, when the renowned Ottoman traveler [Evliya Çelebi](/article/en/Evliya_Celebi) visited Gjakova, the city had transformed into a flourishing commercial center. He described it as an attractive town with approximately 2,000 houses built of stone with roofs and gardens, two richly decorated congregational mosques, several prayer houses, inns with leaden roofs, a delightful bathhouse (hamam), and about 300 shops. Evliya Çelebi's accounts testify to significant economic development and population growth, with crafts, trade, and commerce becoming the primary economic activities.

By the 17th century, Gjakova had grown from a village into a full-fledged city, with population and economic growth driven by migration from rural areas as residents sought to escape feudal exploitation and engage in craftwork and trade. This pattern was characteristic of Albanian cities during the Ottoman period.

**Resistance Movements and Decline**

The city's development began to decline at the end of the 17th century, as Gjakova suffered economic hardships alongside other Kosovo cities during periods of Ottoman instability. However, Gjakova retained its significance as a cultural and commercial center.

During the 19th century, Gjakova became a center of Albanian national consciousness and resistance against Ottoman rule. In **May 1845**, following [Mustafa Reşid Pasha's](/article/en/Mustafa_Resid_Pasha) outlawing of the right to bear arms, approximately 2,000 rebels from the Gjakova region, including members of the highlander tribes of Krasniqi, Gashi, and Bytyçi, rose in revolt against Ottoman taxation and centralization policies. The rebellious force, numbering about 8,000 men, successfully drove the Ottoman garrison from Gjakova, though the Ottomans subsequently suppressed the uprising without reestablishing effective control of the highland regions.

In **1862**, the Ottomans sent Maxharr Pasha with 12 divisions to enforce the [Tanzimat Reforms](/article/en/Tanzimat) in the Gjakova Highlands. Under the leadership of Mic Sokoli and Binak Alia, the tribes of Krasniqi, Gashi, Bytyçi, and Nikaj-Mertur organized resistance near Bujan and were reinforced by forces from Shala led by Mark Lula. After heavy fighting, the rebels defeated the Ottoman forces and expelled them from the highlands.

Local Albanian leaders, such as **Sulejman Aga of Botushë** (Sulejman Aga Batusha), organized sustained resistance and independence movements against Ottoman rule throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. In one significant uprising around 1900, between 5,000 and 6,000 Albanian fighters gathered outside Gjakova to attack the Ottoman garrison.

In **1904**, the Ottomans sent 10 battalions accompanied by artillery to suppress the uprising. [Shemsi Pasha](/article/en/Shemsi_Pasha), appointed to enforce tax collection, arrived at Botusha with five battalions and numerous artillery pieces, beginning bombardment of homes. The 300 Albanian resistance fighters led by Sulejman Aga Batusha suffered 35 casualties, while the Ottomans lost more than 80 soldiers. As an additional 300 Albanian fighters arrived and surrounding Ottoman forces, the Ottoman government dispatched 18 more battalions with artillery. The resulting conflict, led by [Shkup's](/article/en/Skopje) Vali [Shakir Pasha](/article/en/Shakir_Pasha), resulted in more than 900 Ottoman soldier deaths and numerous officer casualties, while Albanian losses were approximately 170 killed or wounded. Shakir Pasha was subsequently ordered to stand down.

**League of Prizren**

Between **3–6 September 1878**, heavy fighting erupted between forces of the nationalist [League of Prizren](/article/en/League_of_Prizren) and the Ottoman Empire. In response to Ottoman Field Marshal [Mehmed Ali Pasha's](/article/en/Mehmed_Ali_Pasha) arrival to enforce the Congress of Berlin's territorial cessions to [Montenegro](/article/en/Montenegro), thousands of Gjakova residents besieged the tower (kulla) where he was staying. The crowd stormed the tower, killing Mehmed Ali Pasha in a bloody confrontation. The ensuing fighting resulted in 280 Ottoman soldier deaths, including 2 Pashas, and approximately 300 wounded—among the most significant military engagements of the League of Prizren's nationalist campaign.

Gjakova remained a center of the [Albanian National Movement](/article/en/Albanian_National_Awakening) during the late 19th century. Albanian intellectuals from the city, educated in the Ottoman Empire's major educational centers, played important roles in opening schools in Albanian and advancing national consciousness during the [Rilindja](/article/en/Rilindja) (Albanian Renaissance).

### Modern Period

**Balkan Wars and Serbian Rule**

During the **First Balkan War** (1912–1913), Serbian and Montenegrin forces captured Gjakova after heavy fighting. In 1912, the [New York Times](/article/en/New_York_Times), citing [Austro-Hungarian](/article/en/Austro-Hungarian_Empire) sources, reported scenes of extreme violence, describing the approach to Gjakova as a "gallows alley" with people hanged on both sides of the road. The Montenegrin military police, particularly the Royal Gendarmerie Corps (Kraljevski žandarmerijski kor) known as krilaši, committed widespread abuses and violence against the non-Orthodox Christian population.

Between 1912 and 1920, control of Gjakova alternated between Serbian and Ottoman forces, with the final Serbian occupation occurring after 1920 following the liquidation of the Neutral Zone of Junik through an agreement between Albanian leader [Ahmet Zogu](/article/en/Ahmet_Zogu) and Serbian politician [Nikola Pašić](/article/en/Nikola_Pasic). This conquest resulted in the violent displacement of hundreds of Gjakova families, many of whom were resettled where the city of [Kukës](/article/en/Kukes) was founded in 1925 in Albania. Other Gjakova families settled in [Shkodër](/article/en/Shkoder), Tirana, and other Albanian cities.

**Religious Persecution and War Crimes**

Following Serbian occupation in the **Balkan Wars**, Serbian authorities conducted a systematic campaign of religious persecution and forced conversions. According to a 20 March 1913 *Neue Freie Presse* article, Orthodox priests and the military forcibly converted approximately 300 Gjakova Catholics to Serbian Orthodoxy. [Franciscan Pater Angelus](/article/en/Pater_Angelus), who refused to renounce his Catholic faith, was tortured and killed with bayonets. The History Institute in Pristina documented that Montenegro forcibly converted over 1,700 Albanian Catholics to the Serbian Orthodox faith in the Gjakova region in March 1913. [Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein](/article/en/Albert_von_Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein) reported to British Foreign Secretary [Edward Grey](/article/en/Edward_Grey) in a 10 March 1912 interview that Serbian soldiers behaved in a "barbarous way" toward Muslim and Catholic Albanians in Gjakova.

The mass hanging of Albanian civilians in 1914 by Serbian and Montenegrin forces and the killing of [Catholic priest Luigj Palaj](/article/en/Luigj_Palaj) were among the most widely reported wartime atrocities in Gjakova.

**In 1913**, as part of the Serbian conquest, the Kaçaks (Albanian resistance fighters) rose against Serbian military administration but were suppressed. On September 7, 1913, Montenegro formally annexed the Gjakova area as an allied partner with Serbia.

**Interwar Period**

Following [World War I](/article/en/World_War_I), Kosovo, including Gjakova, was incorporated into the new [Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes](/article/en/Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats,_and_Slovenes) (later [Yugoslavia](/article/en/Yugoslavia)). In the 1920s and 1930s, as part of Serbian state settlement policy, approximately 13,000 Serbian settlers were established in the Albanian-dominated Gjakova region, causing the Serbian population share to increase significantly from 8.3% to 33%.

During the interwar period, Gjakova experienced industrial development. The city was transformed from its Ottoman old town foundations through significant urban expansion. A Serbian Orthodox Seminary operated in Gjakova during the 18th and 19th centuries, and the first Serbian folk school began operations in 1829 (or 1825) through the efforts of [Hadji Zaharija Dečanac](/article/en/Hadji_Zaharija_Decanac), a Serbian metropolitan.

**World War II**

During **World War II**, when Kosovo was incorporated into the [Kingdom of Albania](/article/en/Kingdom_of_Albania) under Italian rule and later under German control, Serbs were persecuted by Albanian paramilitaries. A large number of killings of Serbs took place in 1941 in the Gjakova district. Some Gjakova families who had fled during Serbian conquest returned during this period, only to flee again in winter 1944 and spring 1945 with the return of Serbian forces.

Toward the end of World War II, Gjakova was captured by [Tito's Partisans](/article/en/Yugoslav_Partisans). On **March 11, 1945**, the first major demonstration in Kosovo took place in Gjakova, when Albanian women protested against the conscription of their men and sons into the People's Liberation Army. One participant was subsequently sentenced to death.

### Yugoslav Period

During the [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](/article/en/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia), Gjakova experienced industrial development. Notably, the **Emin Duraku cotton processing factory** was established, providing employment for approximately 2,000 workers. This industrial development accompanied significant urban expansion of the city beyond its Ottoman foundations.

In **1953–56**, a systemic campaign of police repression was conducted throughout Kosovo with the goal of forcing Albanians to leave the region. The **first protest in Yugoslavia involving the unfurling of the banned [Albanian national flag](/article/en/Flag_of_Albania)** was held in Gjakova on **May Day, 1956**. This historic protest was followed by other demonstrations by high school and university students across Yugoslavia who unfurled the Albanian flag. A total of 19 Albanians were assassinated by the Yugoslav secret police in Gjakova during these events.

Before and during the [Kosovo War](/article/en/Kosovo_War), Gjakova was one of the strongholds of Albanian resistance against Yugoslav state power. From 1997 onward, it became one of the centers of the [Kosovo Liberation Army](/article/en/Kosovo_Liberation_Army) (UCK/KLA), which built administrative structures and undertook actions against non-Albanian populations before being pushed back in summer 1998.

In **1990**, during the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the **Union of Independent Trade Unions of Kosova (BSPK)** was founded in Gjakova. BSPK membership reached 14,900 workers with strong grassroots participation. Although the BSPK founding congress was granted permission to proceed, police forcibly dispersed it during its second day.

### Kosovo War and Aftermath (1998–1999)

The city was severely affected by the **Kosovo War** (1998–1999), suffering massive physical destruction, large-scale human losses, and documented human rights abuses.

**Meja Massacre**

In the rural locality of **Meja**, located approximately 4 kilometers outside Gjakova's city center, a mass killing of at least 377 Albanian males between the ages of 16 and 60 took place on **April 27, 1999**, carried out by Serbian police forces. This massacre constitutes the largest single killing of the Kosovo War. Many victim remains were later discovered in the [Batajnica mass graves](/article/en/Batajnica_massacre). The [International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia](/article/en/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia) (ICTY) convicted multiple Serbian army and police officers for their involvement in the massacre.

**Broader Conflict and Displacement**

According to the ICTY, [OSCE](/article/en/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe), and international human rights organizations, approximately 75% of Gjakova's population was expelled by Serbian police, paramilitaries, and Yugoslav forces, with many civilians killed in the process. Large areas of the city were destroyed through arson, looting, and localized fighting between government security forces and KLA members. The city's old bazaar suffered significant damage before being subsequently renovated.

Yugoslav military units were stationed in and near the city in two barracks due to anticipated attacks from the [Kosovo Liberation Army](/article/en/Kosovo_Liberation_Army) based across the border in Albania. In one incident, [NATO](/article/en/NATO) aircraft misidentified a convoy of Albanian refugees and attacked it, causing casualties.

The actions of government forces in Gjakova formed a major component of the [United Nations](/article/en/United_Nations) war crimes indictment against then-President [Slobodan Milošević](/article/en/Slobodan_Milosevic).

**Hadum Mosque Destruction**

The **Hadum Mosque**, along with its historic library containing rare documents from the mosque's founding period, was burned during the first night of NATO airstrikes by Serbian paramilitary forces, destroying invaluable historical records.

**Post-War Developments and Ethnic Tensions**

Following the end of the war, the majority of the Albanian population returned to Gjakova. Much of the town was rebuilt, though reconstruction efforts focused primarily on residential and commercial areas rather than complete urban restoration.

In the aftermath of the war, many Albanians held the [Roma](/article/en/Romani_people) population collectively responsible for alleged participation in war crimes and collaboration in state repression. The Romani neighborhood of Gjakova (Brekoc) was targeted, with parts burned in mid-1999. Approximately 600 Roma were relocated to a refugee camp outside the town, and as a result of political violence, 15 were reported killed or missing by August 1999.

The Serbian population, numbering approximately 3,000 before the war, largely fled Gjakova in June 1999. Only five Serbs initially remained in the city, living under guard by [KFOR](/article/en/Kosovo_Force) troops at a local Serbian Orthodox Church. In **2004**, these remaining five Serbs were expelled from Gjakova during the **March unrest in Kosovo**, and the Serbian Orthodox Church was destroyed by ethnic Albanians during rioting. By the 2011 census, only about 15 Serbs had returned to Gjakova.

In **2021**, [Dragica Gasic](/article/en/Dragica_Gasic) became the first Serb returnee since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999, returning to her former apartment in Gjakova. Despite being legally allowed to return by the Kosovo Property Agency, her return was marked by threats of violence and harassment from ethnic-Albanian neighbors.

## Geography

### Location and Physical Features

Gjakova is located in the southwestern part of Kosovo, in the [Metohija](/article/en/Metohija) plain region. To the northeast of the city, the large western Kosovan plain of Metohija opens expansively, while to the southwest rises the peak of the [Accursed Mountains](/article/en/Accursed_Mountains) (Prokletije) and other mountain ranges including Pashtrik and Koritnik.

The city is situated at the entrance to the **Erenik Valley**, where the [Krena River](/article/en/Krena_River) flows from the north toward the mountain stream of Erenik. After several kilometers, the Krena flows into the **White Drin** (Drini i Bardhë), the longest river in Kosovo. 

To the west of Gjakova lie the **Gjakova Highlands**, an important mountainous region, while to the northeast is the **Dushkaja region**. The city's territory is encompassed within several cadastral municipalities, including Gjakovica-town (254 ha), Gjakovica-suburbs (2,227 ha), and Sadik-agin zid (299 ha).

Eight kilometers directly north of the city lies the **Radoniq Reservoir**, which is served by hydroelectric power plants that supply electricity to large surrounding areas and plays an important role in regional drinking water supply.

### Water Features and Bridges

Historically, the city was built on both banks of the Krena River, with 12 well-fortified bridges documented as existing in 1900. Several historic bridges connect the city across waterways, including the **Islam-Beg Bridge**, which links the Old Bazaar to the city center (approximately five minutes' walk), the **Tailor's Bridge**, the **Tanner's Bridge**, and bridges at the Drin Gorge.

In 1638, the [Archbishop of Bar](/article/en/Archbishop_of_Bar) reported the city had 320 Muslim homes, 20 Catholic homes, and 20 Orthodox homes. In 1641/42, records documented 16 Orthodox and 250 Muslim houses. By 1853, the city housed 75 Catholic, 80 Orthodox, and 4,000 Muslim homes, plus 300 Roma households. In 1872, Gjakova had approximately 10,000 residents, with the majority Muslim.

During the 19th century, Gjakova's estimated population exceeded 25,000 residents, with at least 17,000 of adult age, according to historian Sami Frashëri.

### Age Structure and Life Expectancy

**Catholic Heritage**: Christianity, particularly Roman Catholicism, has deep roots in Gjakova dating to the Roman Empire period. Catholics primarily live on **Rruga e Katolikëve** (Catholics' Street), where two main churches are located, and in surrounding villages. The presence of Catholics reflects historical connections with the [Albanian Malesia](/article/en/Malesia) region and represents a unique minority within Kosovo.

**Orthodox Heritage**: A small Orthodox Christian community remains, primarily associated with Serbian heritage. During the Ottoman period, a Serbian Orthodox Seminary operated in the city.

Religious communities maintain educational institutions organized in accordance with applicable law. The city has hosted approximately 10–15 mosque buildings throughout centuries, along with Catholic and Orthodox places of worship.

## Economy

### Economic Development and Structure

Gjakova's economy initially developed around farming, agriculture, small-scale trade, and manufacturing workshops producing goods for local consumption and supplementing imports. Following [World War II](/article/en/World_War_II), the city shifted toward an economy driven by industry and agriculture, with an emerging service sector.

Today, Gjakova's economic framework rests on two pillars: the private business sector (rapidly expanding and now the principal economic component) and the social business sector (undergoing privatization).

### Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

According to official data, Gjakova has experienced significant growth in SMEs:

- **2006**: 581 registered SMEs
- **2008**: 3,120 SMEs
- **2012**: 4,120 SMEs

Approximately 12,000 people are employed in both public and private sectors, with the majority in the private sector.

### Employment and Unemployment

Despite persistently high unemployment, employment levels have shown gradual improvement:

- **2010**: 40,000 registered unemployed
- **2011**: 30,000 registered unemployed
- **2012**: 15,000 registered unemployed

Unemployment is particularly severe among women and young people. Additionally, approximately 30,000 residents receive social assistance, including low-income families, individuals with disabilities, families of war veterans and victims, and retirees.

### Private Sector Characteristics

Gjakova's private sector remains relatively weak, dominated by small family-owned businesses, retail shops, cafés, and basic service providers, accounting for only 5.5% of all registered businesses in Kosovo.

Business structure breakdown:
- **88–93%** of active businesses: Sole proprietorships
- **5–10%**: Limited liability companies
- **~2%**: Large enterprises

More than 90% of businesses are small family-run operations with limited capacity to generate added value. A study of 53 businesses in Gjakova's city center revealed that only two had no family members employed.

**Business Sectors** (by registration percentage):
- **Wholesale and retail**: 50.5%
- **Hotels and restaurants**: 10.2%
- **Manufacturing**: 9.7%
- **Transport and communications**: 7.8%
- **Construction**: 4.2%
- **Agriculture**: 1.7%

Most private businesses employ between one and five people and operate in low value-added sectors. Two significant privatized enterprises operate in construction: **"Dukagjini"** (109 employees) and **"NIKI-S"** (279 employees, currently the largest company in the municipality), with only these among 15 privatized ventures and two joint-stock companies being fully operational.

### Industrial Sectors

**Metal Industry**: Produces metal ropes, nails, galvanized pipes, metal profiles, electro motors for washing machines, industrial engines, motors for hermetic compressors, teflon containers, chimneys, elbows, enameled pots, technical gases, and chrome concentrate.

**Textile Industry**: Production of cotton spinning, cotton fabrics, artificial leather, underwear, lingerie, and various fabric types (particularly jeans).

**Chemical Industry**: Production of shampoo for domestic and industrial use and other chemical products for household hygiene.

**Food Industry**: Known for production of flour, bread, eggs, pasta, chocolate, high-quality wines, and fresh meat.

**Construction Industry**: Known for production of bricks, blocks, tiles, doors, windows, briquettes, wooden cottages and log houses at global levels, plus asphalt, fresh concrete, concrete slabs, and concrete pipes.

### Municipal Budget and Investment

The municipal budget has been subsidized by donations from:
- **USAID**
- **CDF** (Community Development Fund)
- **Austrian Office in Kosovo**
- **European Commission**
- Other international donors

Over four years, these sources provided capital investments totaling approximately €25 million:
- **2010**: €5.4 million
- **2011**: €6.3 million
- **2012**: €6.7 million
- **2013**: €6.6 million

Capital investments are primarily directed toward road infrastructure (rehabilitation, paving, partial street lighting installation). However, funding for sewage network expansion and canalisation improvements remains insufficient. The municipality allocates over €6 million annually for capital investment projects.

## Culture and Heritage

### Historical and Architectural Significance

Gjakova possesses significant cultural heritage reflecting its role as an Ottoman trading center and its importance to Albanian national identity. Historical monuments are divided into three main categories based on their cultural, religious, and social context.

The core of the city developed between the **Krena River** to the east and **Cabrati hill** to the west. Around the **Old Bazaar** (Çarshia e Madhe)—the center of trade and craftsmanship—the city's distinctive character emerged. By 1900, the bazaar housed approximately 1,000 enterprises. The bazaar covers an area of about 35,000 m² (380,000 sq ft) with its main road stretching 1 km and approximately 500 shops situated along it.

Due to its ancient origins and rapid economic development, Gjakova became a city of great historical importance. Numerous bridges were constructed to enable the passage of trade caravans across neighboring rivers.

### Major Historic Buildings and Monuments

**Hadum Mosque** (also Hadim Mosque, Hadum's Mosque)
- **Built**: 1594 (sources vary between 1592–1595)
- **Architect**: [Mimar Sinan](/article/en/Mimar_Sinan), the renowned Ottoman architect
- **Financed by**: Hadum Aga (also Hadum Suleyman Efendi), a politically important local Albanian official
