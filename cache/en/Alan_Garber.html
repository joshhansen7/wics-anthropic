# Alan Garber

**Alan Michael Garber** (born May 7, 1955) is an American [physician](/article/en/Physician) and [health economist](/article/en/Health_economics) who has served as the 31st [president of Harvard University](/article/en/Harvard_University) since August 2, 2024. Previously, he served as [provost](/article/en/Provost) of [Harvard University](/article/en/Harvard_University) from 2011 to March 2024. Prior to joining Harvard, Garber was a faculty member at [Stanford University](/article/en/Stanford_University), where he was director of the Center for Health Policy and the Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research at Stanford School of Medicine.

## Early Life and Education

Garber was born in [Rock Island, Illinois](/article/en/Rock_Island,_Illinois), in 1955, to Jean and Harry Garber. According to the French Wikipedia version, his father Harry was born on September 5, 1909 and died on October 19, 1992, while his mother Jean (née Bender) was born on June 15, 1917 in [Milwaukee, Wisconsin](/article/en/Milwaukee,_Wisconsin) and died on July 5, 1996 in [Marin County, California](/article/en/Marin_County,_California). His mother was a [social worker](/article/en/Social_work), while his father owned a liquor store. Garber has a twin sister, Deborah, who is an artist, and an older brother, David, who made [aliyah](/article/en/Aliyah) and lives in [Jerusalem](/article/en/Jerusalem). Belonging to a [Jewish](/article/en/Judaism) family, Garber grew up attending synagogue and a Jewish summer camp. He attended Rock Island High School before graduating from Mather High School in [Chicago](/article/en/Chicago) in 1973.

Garber received a [Bachelor of Arts](/article/en/Bachelor_of_Arts) with a major in [economics](/article/en/Economics) from [Harvard University](/article/en/Harvard_University) in 1976, a [Master of Arts](/article/en/Master_of_Arts) in economics in 1977, and a [PhD](/article/en/Doctor_of_Philosophy) in economics in 1982, all from Harvard University. While pursuing his PhD at Harvard, he enrolled simultaneously at [Stanford University](/article/en/Stanford_University), where he received a [Doctor of Medicine](/article/en/Doctor_of_Medicine) degree with research honors in 1983. He later reflected that he was "a reluctant and ambivalent pre-med" when starting college, switching his major from [biochemistry](/article/en/Biochemistry) to economics, but that his education led "eventually to a career that combined the two interests."

He completed his [residency](/article/en/Medical_residency) training in [internal medicine](/article/en/Internal_medicine) at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](/article/en/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital), affiliated with [Harvard Medical School](/article/en/Harvard_Medical_School), in Boston in 1986.

## Career

### Academic and Clinical Work

Garber began his career as an assistant professor at [Stanford University](/article/en/Stanford_University) in 1986. His research focused on [cost-effectiveness](/article/en/Cost-effectiveness_analysis) in healthcare, particularly on analyzing health systems and health policy, evaluating medical interventions, and improving medical decision-making. While at Stanford, he also worked as a clinician at the [Veterans Affairs](/article/en/Veterans_Affairs) Medical Center in [Palo Alto](/article/en/Palo_Alto,_California). His research has focused on mechanisms to improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare as well as developing policy strategies to address challenges in the healthcare system. He has published numerous articles in scientific journals and authored several books on health economics and policy.

Garber was a member of the [Institute of Medicine](/article/en/National_Academy_of_Medicine) (now National Academy of Medicine) and participated in various government advisory committees in healthcare. He has been honored for his contributions to health economics and health policy with various awards, including the Investigator Award in Health Policy Research from the [Robert Wood Johnson Foundation](/article/en/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation) and the Young Investigator Award from the Association for Health Services Research.

### Harvard Positions

Garber's tenure at Stanford ended in 2011, when he left to succeed [Steven Hyman](/article/en/Steven_Hyman) as the provost of Harvard University on September 1, 2011. He served as provost until March 14, 2024, when [John F. Manning](/article/en/John_F._Manning) took on the position on an interim basis.

Since joining Harvard, Garber has held various academic positions and titles, including:
- Mallinckrodt Professor of Health Care Policy at [Harvard Medical School](/article/en/Harvard_Medical_School)
- Professor of Economics in the [Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences](/article/en/Harvard_College)
- Professor of Public Policy at [Harvard Kennedy School](/article/en/Harvard_Kennedy_School)
- Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](/article/en/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health)

### Presidency of Harvard University

Garber succeeded [Claudine Gay](/article/en/Claudine_Gay) as president of Harvard University in 2024, following her resignation in the wake of the controversy over [antisemitism](/article/en/Antisemitism) at Harvard and revelations about her plagiarism. He was initially appointed as interim president on January 2, 2024. On August 2, 2024, the [Harvard Corporation](/article/en/Harvard_Corporation) announced that he would be the permanent president of the university for a fixed term of three years ending at the conclusion of the 2026–2027 academic year. He was installed as the 31st president of Harvard University on December 7, 2024, in a private ceremony at Menschel Hall, one of the [Harvard Art Museums](/article/en/Harvard_Art_Museums).

On December 15, 2025, Harvard announced that Garber would remain as the university's president indefinitely, superseding the original three-year fixed term.

In 2025, he was elected to the [American Philosophical Society](/article/en/American_Philosophical_Society).

## Tenure as Provost and President

### Opposition to Graduate Student Unionization

In July 2016, the Harvard University Office of the Provost launched a web page in response to efforts to [unionize](/article/en/Labor_union) its graduate students. On August 23, 2016, following the [Columbia](/article/en/Columbia_University) decision that restored union rights to teaching and research assistants, the provost office wrote in an email to students: "we continue to believe that the relationship between students and the University is primarily about education, and that unionization will disrupt academic programs and freedoms, mentoring, and research at Harvard."

Following a decision by the regional director of the [National Labor Relations Board](/article/en/National_Labor_Relations_Board) that Harvard was in violation of the [Excelsior rule](/article/en/Excelsior_rule), Garber defended the university's appeal to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C., writing that the university "believes that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of well-informed students, should stand, and has appealed the Regional Director's decision to the contrary."

### Private Corporation Board Memberships

In October 2019, The [Harvard Crimson](/article/en/The_Harvard_Crimson) reported that [SEC](/article/en/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) filings record that since being appointed as Harvard's provost in 2011, Garber earned more than $2.7 million by serving on the boards of directors for two pharmaceutical companies, [Exelixis](/article/en/Exelixis) and [Vertex Pharmaceuticals](/article/en/Vertex_Pharmaceuticals). Garber responded that he had thoroughly disclosed his industry affiliations in conflict of interest forms for the university, and the companies indicated that his compensation was normal for board members.

### 2024 Commencement

The Harvard administration drew criticism for preventing 13 undergraduates from collecting their diplomas at the May 2024 commencement ceremony as a consequence of their participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Nearly 500 Harvard faculty and students criticized the sanctions as disproportionate, unprecedented, and designed to stifle open discourse, while others identified the action as an example of an "exception" to free speech. The decision was initially overturned by 115 faculty members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, but was reinstated by the Harvard Corporation later that week in May 2025.

### Clash with the Trump Administration

On April 11, 2025, the [Trump administration](/article/en/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump) sent a letter to Garber threatening to cut back billions in federal funding unless Harvard accepted government demands that included requirements to "audit" the viewpoints of student body, faculty, staff, and to "reduce the power" of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their political views. The letter also demanded that several pro-Palestinian student organizations be dismantled and banned.

On April 14, Garber announced that Harvard had informed the administration through its legal counsel that the university had refused the administration's proposed agreement. Garber's decision was hailed by left-leaning political personalities including [Barack Obama](/article/en/Barack_Obama) and [Bernie Sanders](/article/en/Bernie_Sanders). In response, the Trump administration began a series of legal assaults against the university, including asking the [Internal Revenue Service](/article/en/Internal_Revenue_Service) to revoke the tax-exempt status of the university, freezing $2.2 billion in federal funding to the university, and barring the university from enrolling international students.

At the University's 2025 commencement the following month, Garber received multiple standing ovations during his speech. He received similar applause at the annual Alumni Day celebration the following week. According to [The Atlantic](/article/en/The_Atlantic), Garber believes that Harvard has failed to confront campus antisemitism similarly to the position of the Trump administration.

## Personal Life

Garber married Anne Yahanda (also identified as Anne M. Yahanda, MD), an [oncologist](/article/en/Oncology), in 1988. They met at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](/article/en/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital), where both were completing post-graduate training. They have four children, all of whom attended [Harvard University](/article/en/Harvard_University).

Garber is an observant [Jew](/article/en/Judaism).
