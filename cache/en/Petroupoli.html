# Petroupoli

**Petroupoli** (Greek: Πετρούπολη, meaning "city of Petros/Peter") is a semi-mountainous municipality in [Attica](/article/en/Attica), [Greece](/article/en/Greece), located in the northwestern suburbs of [Athens](/article/en/Athens). The municipality is situated on the slopes of Mount Poikilo (also known as Zacharitsa) in the western part of the [Athens metropolitan area](/article/en/Athens_metropolitan_area). Petroupoli was established as a separate community in 1946 after being part of [Nea Liosia](/article/en/Nea_Liosia) (now known as [Ilion](/article/en/Ilion)), and was elevated to municipality status in 1972.

## Geography

Petroupoli extends at an average elevation of 140 meters on the northwestern edge of the Athenian Basin at the foot of the [Egaleo](/article/en/Egaleo) (Aigáleo) mountain range. The municipality is situated approximately 6–8 kilometers northwest of [Athens](/article/en/Athens) city center and 26 kilometers northwest of [Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos"](/article/en/Athens_International_Airport_%22Eleftherios_Venizelos%22).

### Area and Topography

The municipality has an area of 6.597 square kilometers with a population density of 8,940 residents per square kilometer. Within the municipality's territory, the summit of Pikilo or Zacharitsa forms the highest point at between 442–465 meters above sea level. The terrain slopes down from approximately 215–225 meters in the elevated western and central areas to around 80–114 meters in the southeastern sections.

The rocky landscape extends across the entire length of the municipality on the northwestern side and is covered with bushes and low trees. The street grid is laid out regularly at right angles, with the municipality's streets running in a southwest-northeast and northwest-southeast direction, reflecting the slope of the terrain.

### Administrative Divisions

Petroupoli is divided into four districts (or neighborhoods) containing ten residential neighborhoods:

* Agia Triada (Αγία Τριάδα)
* Agios Dimitrios (Άγιος Δημήτριος)
* Ano Petroupoli (Άνω Πετρούπολη) — Upper Petroupoli
* Kato Petroupoli (Κάτω Πετρούπολη) — Lower Petroupoli
* Kipoupoli (Κηπούπολη)
* Michelis (Μιχελής)
* Nisaki (Νησάκι)
* Panorama (Πανόραμα)
* Palatiani (Παλατιανή)
* Pefka Verdi (Πεύκα Βέρδι)

### Borders

The municipality borders several neighboring municipalities: [Ilion](/article/en/Ilion), [Peristeri](/article/en/Peristeri), [Agioi Anargyroi-Kamatero](/article/en/Agioi_Anargyroi-Kamatero), and [Fyli](/article/en/Fyli) (located beyond Mount Poikilo). To the west and northwest, across the Egaleo mountain range, lie the municipalities of [Aspropyrgos](/article/en/Aspropyrgos) and [Fyli](/article/en/Fyli), while to the southwest is [Chaidari](/article/en/Chaidari).

## History

### Etymology

Two competing theories explain the origin of Petroupoli's name. The first theory suggests that the city is named after the Greek word for "stone" or "rock" (*petra*), as the area's soil is rocky and there were quarries on the Egaleo in the past. This interpretation is supported by the city's later cultural branding as "The City of Stone."

The more widely accepted theory is that Petroupoli is named in honor of **Petros A. Giannaros**, founder of the [Esperini](/article/en/Esperini) newspaper (also spelled "Esperi"). In the early 1930s, when Giannaros's son, **Alexandros Giannaros**, took over as publisher, the newspaper distributed coupons for acquiring plots in the area that would become central and upper Petroupoli. Notably, Petroupoli is also the name commonly used in Greek for [Saint Petersburg](/article/en/Saint_Petersburg).

### Early Development and Pre-Urban Period

Even in the 19th century, the area consisted mainly of forest, arable land, and pasture and was used by shepherds from the mountains of [Central Greece](/article/en/Central_Greece) as winter grazing grounds. One notable shepherd, the Arvanite **Panousis Verdis**, claimed in 1842 to have purchased a piece of land called Klisoura on Mount Pikilo from a Turk in 1815. The northeast of the present municipality's territory belonged to wealthy Athenian families as large estates.

From 1912 onwards, the land was administered as part of the municipality of [Athens](/article/en/Athens). From 1925 to 1946, it was under the jurisdiction of [Nea Liosia](/article/en/Nea_Liosia). The [population exchange between Greece and Turkey](/article/en/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey) in the early 1920s, resulting from the [Greco-Turkish War](/article/en/Greco-Turkish_War), caused a dramatic surge in the population of the [Athenian Basin](/article/en/Athenian_Basin). This population influx led to a flight from [Athens](/article/en/Athens) city center and the establishment of settlements at the edge of the Athenian Plain.

### Interwar Urban Development

The urban development of the present municipality's territory originated from two major construction projects of the [interwar period](/article/en/Interwar_period).

**Kipoupoli Development:** Through the heirs of Panousis Verdis's estate in the southwest of the present municipality, a real estate company was founded to build a garden city modeled on [British examples](/article/en/Garden_city_movement). The project was built for a "cooperative of the landless" and was recognized by two presidential decrees in February 1929 as a "settlement of the landless" (Greek: *Sinikismos ton Aktimonon*). In April 1929, it was designated by a development plan as the Verdi settlement.

**Central Petroupoli Development:** In the area of the municipality's present center, two large landowners named **Noe** and **Tsouklidis** sold a plot to **Alexandros Giannaros**, the publisher of the newspaper Esperini. On July 28, 1933, he published a development plan in his newspaper featuring 165 residential blocks, for which vouchers could be purchased and paid off in installments of 50 drachmas. This plan corresponds to the present street layout in the center and in Ano Petroupoli, with the present main street 25 March Avenue (25is Martiou) marked as "Petroupoli Boulevard" and the crossing 28 October Street (28is Okrovriou) marked after the publisher as "Alexandros Giannaros Boulevard." A second plan by architect **Alexandros Metaxas** in June 1934 designated 40 additional blocks in the present Nisaki district.

### Mid-20th Century Development

Construction of the first houses began in 1935. The small church of Saint Dimitrios was built in 1937, and the first primary school opened in 1938. By the end of 1938, only 300 residents had settled in Petroupoli.

On May 20, 1934, the city's official inauguration and planning layout took place. The original city plan included 166 building blocks, which was expanded to 206 shortly thereafter.

In 1940, Petroupoli, with 641 inhabitants, was recognized as a settlement within the municipality of Nea Liosia. It gained independence as a rural municipality (*kinotita*) on September 18, 1946. It was officially upgraded to a municipal corporation (*dimos*) in 1972.

### Post-World War II Urban Expansion

The area was built up mainly from the early 1950s through the 1990s. Construction activity continues today but is now significantly limited. The eastern and central parts of the municipality became more urbanized during this period, while the rocky landscape of Mount Poikilo in the west and north remained largely undeveloped.

### Mining and Industrial History

From the late 1940s through the 1980s, [limestone](/article/en/Limestone) was extracted in Petroupoli in a total of eight quarries. In 1953, extraction began in the Emos (Αίμος) limestone quarry in Ano Petroupoli, whose remains characterize the city's landscape today. Quarrying was common in the western section from the 1960s until several decades later. One of the abandoned quarries located approximately 1 kilometer northwest was converted into a park, and several others became sports facilities. The quarry remains have become integral to Petroupoli's cultural identity and landscape.

## Demographics

Petroupoli's population has fluctuated throughout its modern history. Estimates vary depending on the source and year:

* 1940: 641 inhabitants
* 1991: approximately 47,000 (municipal estimates)
* 2001: approximately 48,327–65,000 (estimates vary)
* 2011: 58,979 residents (national census)
* 2021: 60,146 residents (estimated)

The municipality has an average population density of 8,940 residents per square kilometer.

## Politics and Administration

## Culture and Education

### Stone Theater and International Stone Festival

One of the municipality's most significant cultural landmarks is the **Theatro Petras** (Stone Theater), also known as the **Petra Theater**. Located in the converted Emos limestone quarry at approximately 260 meters elevation, the open-air theater with two stages was established in the early 1980s at the suggestion of **Minoas Volanakis**, a prominent cultural figure, with the support of then-Mayor Nikos Paximadas.

Volanakis recognized the "rough and pure aesthetic quality" and "primordial elegance of Stone" in these unrecognized quarry spaces, transforming industrial sites into cultural venues. The Stone Theater has become the central venue for the **International Petra Festival** (also called the **International Stone Festival** or **Stone Festival**), which takes place every summer and features concerts, theatrical performances, and other cultural events.

## Infrastructure and Services

### Transportation

**Motorways:**
The [Greek motorway network](/article/en/Greek_motorway_network) is accessible from Petroupoli primarily via city streets. The [A1 motorway](/article/en/A1_motorway_(Greece)) (part of the [European route E75](/article/en/European_route_E75)), which connects [Piraeus](/article/en/Piraeus)–[Athens](/article/en/Athens)–[Thessaloniki](/article/en/Thessaloniki)–[Evzoni](/article/en/Evzoni), runs approximately 3 kilometers to the southwest. The [A65 motorway](/article/en/A65_motorway_(Greece)) runs approximately 6 kilometers away from the municipality behind the Egaleo mountain range, with no direct connection.

**Public Transportation:**
Public local transport is limited to buses, with no direct connection to the motorway network. The municipality's main streets—25 March Avenue, Anatolikis Romylias Street, and Perikleous Street—connect the town with [Ilion](/article/en/Ilion) and [Peristeri](/article/en/Peristeri).

### Regional Development Assessment

The **ASDA** (Association for the Development of Western Athens / West-Athens Development Association) regards Petroupoli as one of the most developed towns in the administrative sector of [West Athens](/article/en/West_Athens). The city is favored by its location directly at Pikilo as one of the few natural areas in the capital region.

### Environmental and Urban Challenges

Despite its development status, Petroupoli faces several challenges:
* Lack of green and open spaces within the city
* Traffic congestion
* Proximity to the [Ano Liosia landfill](/article/en/Ano_Liosia_landfill) (located behind Mount Poikilo)
* Limited accessibility to major motorway networks
