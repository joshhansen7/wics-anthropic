# International Workers' Day

International Workers' Day, also called [Labour Day](/article/en/Labour_Day) or May Day, is an annual celebration of laborers and the working classes that is promoted by the international [labor movement](/article/en/Labor_movement) and occurs every year on May 1, or the first Monday in May in some countries. It is a public holiday in many countries around the world.

The date was chosen to commemorate the [Haymarket affair](/article/en/Haymarket_affair), which occurred in Chicago, USA, on May 4, 1886. This day marks the struggle for an [eight-hour workday](/article/en/Eight-hour_day) and has become a significant date for demonstrations by various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups since the establishment of the [Second International](/article/en/Second_International) in 1889.

## History

### Origin

The origin of International Workers' Day is tied to the labor movements for communist and socialist political parties and their struggle for fair employment standards in the late 19th century.

On April 21, 1856, Australian stonemasons in [Victoria](/article/en/Victoria_(Australia)) undertook a mass stoppage as part of the eight-hour workday movement. It became a yearly commemoration, inspiring American workers to have their first stoppage. 

In the United States, the [Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions](/article/en/Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions) held a convention in Chicago in 1884 where they called for a general strike on May 1, 1886, to demand an eight-hour workday. May 1 was traditionally the "moving day" in the United States, when employment relationships ended and workers often had to relocate to find new work.

### Haymarket Affair

The [Haymarket affair](/article/en/Haymarket_affair) is considered the origin of International Workers' Day. On May 1, 1886, a general strike began in the United States with about 340,000 workers participating across the country. In Chicago, the strike continued in certain companies. On May 3, 1886, police killed three strikers during a labor demonstration at the [McCormick Harvesting Machine Company](/article/en/McCormick_Harvesting_Machine_Company).

On May 4, 1886, labor leaders organized a public meeting in Haymarket Square to protest the killings. As the meeting was concluding, police moved in to disperse the crowd. An unidentified person threw a bomb at the police, killing one officer immediately. The police responded by firing on the workers. The resulting violence led to the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; sixty police officers were injured, as were about one hundred and fifteen civilians. 

Following this event, eight anarchists were arrested and charged with conspiracy in what many considered a show trial. Four were executed by hanging on November 11, 1887 (later known as "Black Friday"): [Albert Parsons](/article/en/Albert_Parsons), [Adolph Fischer](/article/en/Adolph_Fischer), [George Engel](/article/en/George_Engel), and [August Spies](/article/en/August_Spies). One of the accused, [Louis Lingg](/article/en/Louis_Lingg), committed suicide in his cell. The remaining three were sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1893, they were pardoned by Illinois Governor [John Peter Altgeld](/article/en/John_Peter_Altgeld), who concluded all eight defendants were innocent.

On August Spies' memorial are inscribed his last words:

"The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today."

The following day on May 5, in [Milwaukee, Wisconsin](/article/en/Milwaukee), the state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.

### Establishment as International Workers' Day

In 1889, the [Second International](/article/en/Second_International) met in Paris on the centenary of the [French Revolution](/article/en/French_Revolution) and the [World's Fair](/article/en/World's_Fair). On July 20, 1889, the organization decided to make May 1, 1890, a day of demonstration for the eight-hour workday. The date was explicitly chosen to commemorate the Haymarket affair and was based on a resolution by the [American Federation of Labor](/article/en/American_Federation_of_Labor) to organize demonstrations on May 1, 1890.

On May 1, 1890, demonstrations took place for the first time in most countries, with varying participation. In 1891, the Second International formally recognized May 1 as an annual International Workers' Day at its congress in Brussels.

On May 1, 1891, in [Fourmies, France](/article/en/Fourmies), a demonstration turned tragic when troops fired on the crowd, killing ten people, including two children. This incident further entrenched May 1 in the tradition of worker struggle in Europe. Militants pinned a red wild rose in remembrance of the bloodshed.

## Institutionalization by States

### Russia and Soviet Union

In Russia, the first May Day celebration was observed in 1890 in Warsaw (then part of the Russian Empire) with a strike by 10,000 workers. From 1897, May Day celebrations began to take on a political character and were accompanied by mass demonstrations. In 1912-1914, more than 400,000 workers participated in May Day strikes and demonstrations.

After the [February Revolution](/article/en/February_Revolution) of 1917, May Day was celebrated openly for the first time in Russia, with millions of workers demonstrating. Following the [October Revolution](/article/en/October_Revolution), May Day became an official holiday in 1918. In the [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic](/article/en/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic) (RSFSR) and later in the USSR, it was initially called "International Day" and then "Day of International Workers' Solidarity." 

During the Soviet era, May 1 and 2 were non-working days, with May 2 becoming an additional holiday in 1928. On May 1, workers' demonstrations and military parades were held. The first May Day parade of the Red Army took place in 1918 at [Khodynka Field](/article/en/Khodynka_Field). In the era of "[developed socialism](/article/en/Developed_socialism)," May Day demonstrations expressed solidarity with revolutionary struggles in capitalist countries and national liberation movements.

Elaborate workforce parades were organized in every Soviet town and city, with the largest celebration in Moscow's [Red Square](/article/en/Red_Square), where party and government leaders stood atop [Lenin's Mausoleum](/article/en/Lenin's_Mausoleum) and greeted the crowds. Workers carried banners with political slogans, and companies decorated their vehicles. These massive parades became an enduring symbol of the Soviet era.

The last official May Day demonstration in the USSR took place in 1990, followed by an unofficial procession of democratic forces under anti-Soviet slogans. In 1991, a rally organized by the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions was held on Red Square to protest price increases.

### Germany

In Germany, the Weimar National Assembly attempted to declare May 1 a public holiday on April 15, 1919, but only succeeded in establishing it for that year. The "Bloody May" (Berlin, 1929) highlighted the contradictions between the German Communist Party (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

During the Nazi period, May 1 was made a legal holiday from 1933 onward, called the "Day of National Labor." In 1934, through a legal amendment, it was declared a "National Holiday of the German People." On May 2, 1933, the trade unions in Germany were brought into line with Nazi policies, with union houses stormed and assets confiscated.

After World War II, May 1 was confirmed as a holiday in 1946 by the Allied Control Council. In modern Germany, May 1 is a public holiday according to the laws of the federal states. In North Rhine-Westphalia, it is observed as the "Day of Commitment to Freedom and Peace, Social Justice, International Reconciliation and Human Dignity." In Hesse, May 1 is explicitly recognized by the state constitution as a "holiday for all working people."

Since the 1980s, May Day in Berlin has become known for clashes between radical left groups and police, particularly in connection with the May 1 demonstration in [Kreuzberg](/article/en/Kreuzberg).

### France

On April 23, 1919, the French Senate ratified the eight-hour workday and made May 1, 1919, a non-working day. During the Vichy regime, on April 24, 1941, Marshal Pétain officially established May 1 as the "Celebration of Labor and Social Harmony," applying the motto "Work, Family, Homeland." The day became a paid public holiday, and the red wild rose was replaced by lily of the valley. This celebration disappeared at the Liberation.

In April 1947, on the proposal of Socialist deputy Daniel Mayer and with the support of Communist Labor Minister Ambroise Croizat, May 1 was re-established as a paid non-working day in the French labor code. Law No. 48-746 of April 29, 1948, made May 1 a non-working but paid public holiday.

In modern France, trade union demonstrations take place in major cities on May 1, with the most important traditionally held in Paris. The custom of offering lily of the valley on May 1 reportedly dates back to the Renaissance, when King Charles IX offered it each spring to the ladies of his court.

### Italy

In Italy, May Day has been observed as Workers' Day since 1890. After 1921, during the fascist period under Benito Mussolini, it was officially abolished and replaced by April 21 as "Birth of Rome – Labor Day" (Natale di Roma – Festa di lavoro). April 21 was the official holiday of the Fascists, distinguishing it from the Socialist celebration. After the fall of fascism in 1945, May 1 was restored as Labor Day (Festa del lavoro or Festa dei lavoratori).

In 1947, the celebration at [Portella della Ginestra](/article/en/Portella_della_Ginestra_massacre) in Sicily was marked by tragedy when the gang of [Salvatore Giuliano](/article/en/Salvatore_Giuliano) fired on a procession of about three thousand peasants, killing eleven people and wounding fifty. This event is known as the "Portella della Ginestra massacre."

Since 1990, Italian unions have organized an annual concert in Rome to celebrate May 1, attracting hundreds of thousands of people.

### United Kingdom and Ireland

In the United Kingdom, "Early May Bank Holiday" is celebrated on the first Monday in May. It was established as a public holiday in 1978.

In Ireland, the first Monday in May has been a public holiday since 1994 in the Republic and since 1978 in Northern Ireland. In the Republic, the holiday was proposed by the Labour Party in coalition negotiations with Fianna Fáil in 1992-94, and marked the centenary of the Irish Trades Union Congress. The holiday has no official designation, such as "Workers' Day."

### United States and Canada

In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the 1880s. In 1882, Matthew Maguire, a machinist, proposed a Labor Day holiday on the first Monday of September while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union of New York. Others argue that it was proposed by Peter J. McGuire of the American Federation of Labor after witnessing the annual labor festival in Toronto, Canada.

In 1887, Oregon became the first U.S. state to make Labor Day an official public holiday. By 1894, when it became a federal holiday, thirty states officially celebrated Labor Day. The decision to establish Labor Day in September rather than May was partly to avoid association with the Haymarket affair and to diminish the influence of socialist and anarchist movements.

In 1947, May 1 was established as [Loyalty Day](/article/en/Loyalty_Day) by the U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars to counter communist influence at International Workers' Day rallies. In 1958, the American Bar Association campaigned to have May 1 designated as [Law Day](/article/en/Law_Day_(United_States)), which was acknowledged in 1961 by a joint resolution of Congress.

Nevertheless, labor unions and political organizations, including anarchist groups and socialist and communist parties, have maintained the International Workers' Day tradition with rallies and demonstrations. In 1919, particularly large demonstrations took place, and violence occurred at usually peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, resulting in several deaths. In Milwaukee, an annual commemoration takes place at the site where seven workers were killed during an 8-hour march.

In 2006, May 1 was chosen by Latino immigrant groups for the [Great American Boycott](/article/en/Great_American_Boycott), a general strike of undocumented workers and supporters protesting H.R. 4437, immigration reform legislation they considered draconian. In subsequent years, May Day has continued to be a focal point for immigration rights demonstrations, labor protests, and activism by the [Occupy Wall Street](/article/en/Occupy_Wall_Street) movement.

In Canada, Labour Day is also celebrated in September. However, International Workers' Day is marked by unions and leftists on May 1, particularly in Quebec, where it is an important day for trade union and community group protests dating back to 1906.

### China

In the People's Republic of China, International Labor Day (劳动节, láodòngjié) is a statutory holiday celebrated on May 1. Before 2008, it was a three-day holiday, but was subsequently reduced to one day. During a [Golden Week](/article/en/Golden_Week_(China)), surrounding weekends are rescheduled to give workers several continuous days off.

### Other Countries

May 1 is celebrated as International Workers' Day or Labor Day in numerous countries across all continents, including most countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In some countries, the holiday has additional or different names, reflecting local traditions or political contexts:

- In Kazakhstan, May 1 is celebrated as the Holiday of Unity of the People of Kazakhstan, with the Labor Day celebration canceled since 1996.
- In Finland, May Day (Vappu) is also a spring carnival for students, beginning on April 30 when students place a white cap on the statue of the nymph Havis Amanda in Helsinki.
- In Cuba, el día del trabajadores (Workers' Day) features large parades and demonstrations by workers.
- In South Africa, Workers' Day has been celebrated as a national public holiday on May 1 since 1995, following the end of the apartheid regime.
- In Australia, Labor Day varies by state and is not universally celebrated on May 1.
- In New Zealand, Labour Day is celebrated on the fourth Monday in October, commemorating the eight-hour workday movement that began in 1840.

## Religious Perspectives

### Catholicism

In 1955, Pope Pius XII established May 1 as the feast day of [Saint Joseph the Worker](/article/en/Saint_Joseph_the_Worker), in response to the May Day celebrations of the labor movement. Saint Joseph, the husband of Mary and foster father of Jesus, is considered the patron saint of workers and craftsmen. This was an attempt to Christianize the workers' celebration and was based on the initiative of Pope Leo XIII, who in 1889 had made Saint Joseph the "patron saint of fathers and workers."

### Protestantism

In Protestant churches, May Day is not a holiday, but the lectionary addresses the theme of "work." The liturgical color for services related to labor is violet. Some Protestant communities offer "prayer services for blessed work," which can also be observed on Harvest Prayer Day.

## Traditions and Symbols

### May Flowers

May 1 was traditionally celebrated in Europe through May Day customs, some of which carried over to the workers' celebrations.

In France, the tradition of offering lily of the valley on May 1 reportedly dates back to the Renaissance. In the early 20th century, it became customary to offer a sprig of lily of the valley as a symbol of spring. This tradition was reinforced during the Vichy regime when Marshal Pétain replaced the wild rose (associated with the left) with lily of the valley.

Today, French tax regulations allow individuals and workers' organizations to sell sprigs of lily of the valley on public roads without formal taxes on May 1, provided they are gathered from the wild rather than purchased for resale.

In Germany, people traditionally wear a red carnation in their buttonhole for Labor Day. This tradition dates back to May 1, 1890, when militants decided to meet in parks wearing a red carnation as a sign of recognition, despite the ban on demonstrations under the anti-socialist laws.

### Parades and Demonstrations

May Day celebrations often include parades and demonstrations organized by trade unions, labor associations, and left-wing political parties. These events typically feature speeches by labor leaders and government officials, as well as displays of worker solidarity. Depending on the country and political context, these demonstrations can range from festive celebrations to politically charged protests.

In some countries with socialist histories, such as Cuba and North Korea, May Day parades often include displays of military hardware and soldiers, emphasizing the connection between the working class and the state.

## Regional Observances

### Africa

Many African countries celebrate May 1 as Labor Day or Workers' Day, including Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.

In South Africa, Workers' Day gained prominence in 1928 with mass marches of thousands of workers. In 1986, the hundredth anniversary of the Haymarket affair, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) called for the government to establish an official holiday on May 1 and for workers to stay home. More than 1.5 million workers observed the call, along with students, taxi drivers, vendors, and others. After South Africa's first universal election in 1994, May 1 was adopted as a public holiday, celebrated for the first time in 1995.

### Americas

In Latin America, most countries celebrate May 1 as Labor Day (Día del Trabajo) or International Workers' Day. These include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

In Argentina, Workers' Day is associated with labor unions and features demonstrations in major cities. The first Workers' Day celebration was in 1890, and it became an official holiday in 1930 under President Hipólito Yrigoyen. The day gained particular significance during Juan Domingo Perón's worker-oriented government (1946-55).

In Brazil, "Workers' Day" is an official holiday celebrated on May 1, and unions commemorate it with day-long public events. In Chile, it was declared a national holiday in 1931 by President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo in honor of workers' dignity.

### Asia

In Asia, International Workers' Day is observed in various forms across different countries:

- In Bangladesh, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Singapore, May 1 is a public holiday known as Labor Day or International Workers' Solidarity Day.
- In India, Labor Day is tied to labor movements for communist and socialist political parties. It was first celebrated in Madras (now Chennai) in 1923 by the Labor Kisan Party of Hindustan. May 1 is also celebrated as "Maharashtra Day" and "Gujarat Day" to mark the formation of these states in 1960.
- In Japan, Labor Day is called May Day (メーデー, Mē Dē). The first May Day celebration in Japan took place in 1920, with about 10,000 workers gathering in Ueno Park in Tokyo to demand the eight-hour day. May 1 is not a legal holiday in Japan; instead, Labor Thanksgiving Day is celebrated on November 23.
- In the Philippines, Labor Day (Araw ng Paggawa) marks the day in 1903 when thousands of workers organized by the Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina marched to Malacañang Palace to demonstrate for workers' rights. The holiday was officially recognized in 1908.

### Europe

Most European countries celebrate May 1 as a public holiday, though traditions and official names vary:

- In Austria, May Day rallies have been held since 1890. The holiday was established as a "general day of rest and celebration" on April 25, 1919, along with November 12 as the first national holiday. It was banned during Austrofascism in 1933 but restored after 1945.
- In Switzerland, May 1 is a holiday in some cantons (Basel-Land, Basel-Stadt, Jura, Neuchâtel, Schaffhausen, Thurgau, Ticino, and Zürich) but not in others. In Zürich, the May 1 celebrations are among the largest regularly held rallies in Switzerland.
- In Belgium and Luxembourg, May 1 has been an official holiday since 1948, with various socialist and communist organizations holding parades and events in different cities.
- In Eastern European countries that were part of the Soviet bloc, May 1 was celebrated with elaborate state-organized parades. After the fall of communism, the holiday has continued in many of these countries but often with a different character.
- In Spain, May Day was observed during the Second Spanish Republic from 1931 to 1936/1939 and again from 1977 after the end of Francisco Franco's dictatorship.
- In Portugal, Workers' Day (Dia do Trabalhador) was suppressed during the Estado Novo dictatorship but was celebrated one week after the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, in the largest demonstration in Portuguese history.

## Current Status and Significance

Today, International Workers' Day continues to be celebrated in most countries around the world, though its character and significance vary widely depending on local political and cultural contexts. In many places, it remains a day for labor unions and workers' organizations to demonstrate and advocate for workers' rights and social justice.

However, in some countries, particularly in the West, the holiday has lost much of its political character and has become more of a general celebration of spring or simply a day off work. In countries with socialist or communist histories, the day often retains strong political associations and is marked by official celebrations.

The demands associated with May Day have evolved from the original call for an eight-hour workday to encompass broader issues of workers' rights, social justice, economic equality, and, in recent years, issues such as immigration rights, climate justice, and opposition to austerity measures.

Despite these changes, International Workers' Day continues to serve as a reminder of the historic struggles of the labor movement and the ongoing importance of workers' solidarity and collective action in addressing economic and social challenges.
