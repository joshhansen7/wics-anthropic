# Subsonica

Subsonica is an Italian [rock](/article/en/rock_music) band formed in [Turin](/article/en/Turin) in 1996, bringing together some of the best representatives of the Turin [alternative music](/article/en/alternative_music) scene. The band's unique sound blends rock, electronic, and experimental elements that have made them one of Italy's most influential musical groups. Throughout their career, they have released 10 studio albums, sold approximately 400,000 records, and received numerous prestigious awards.

## History

### Formation and Name Origin (1996)

Subsonica was founded in the summer of 1996 by Max Casacci, Davide "Boosta" Dileo, and Samuel Romano, all prominent figures in Turin's alternative music scene. Max Casacci, a guitarist, had previously been a member of the [reggae](/article/en/reggae) group [Africa Unite](/article/en/Africa_Unite), while Boosta and Samuel played together in a band called Amici di Roland. They were soon joined by Enrico "Ninja" Matta, who had experience playing drums for [Ornella Vanoni](/article/en/Ornella_Vanoni) after stints with groups like Karamamma, and Pierpaolo "Pierfunk" Peretti Griva, a bassist who had collaborated with numerous Italian artists including [Loredana Bertè](/article/en/Loredana_Bertè) and [Marcella Bella](/article/en/Marcella_Bella).

The band's name emerged from a combination of two words. Samuel suggested "Sonica," inspired by a song by the group [Marlene Kuntz](/article/en/Marlene_Kuntz), while Max proposed "Subacqueo" (underwater), the title of a song he had written with Africa Unite. Max's girlfriend, actress Ana Valeria Dini, suggested blending the two names, creating "Subsonica." With this name, they released their first self-produced demo containing five tracks, which helped them secure a contract with the record label [Mescal](/article/en/Mescal_Records).

### Early Years and First Album (1997-1999)

In the spring of 1997, Casacci and Boosta released the single "Istantanee" (Snapshots), which anticipated "Subsonica," the group's first album. That same year, at the suggestion of [Antonella Ruggiero](/article/en/Antonella_Ruggiero), they recorded "Il video sono io" (I Am the Video) and "Per un'ora d'amore" (For an Hour of Love), two songs by [Matia Bazar](/article/en/Matia_Bazar) used in the album "Registrazioni moderne" (Modern Recordings). "Per un'ora d'amore" was chosen as the lead single for Ruggiero's album, and their appearance in the related music video provided the band with visibility.

1998 was dedicated to live performances throughout Italy, with almost 150 concerts between January and October. The singles "Cose che non ho" (Things I Don't Have), "Radioestensioni" (Radio Extensions), and "Preso blu" (Blue Taken) were released during this period. The latter included two instrumental tracks that were remixed and published in England by the London label Lacerba, which entrusted the work to DJs Residente Filters and Terminal Head. The result was the track "U.F.O.," which placed seventh in the ranking of the English magazine [DJ Magazine](/article/en/DJ_Magazine).

In December 1998, "Subsonica" was reprinted, accompanied by a mini live CD titled "Coi piedi sul palco" (With Feet on Stage). The album opens with "Come se" (As If), a track dedicated to [Silvia Baraldini](/article/en/Silvia_Baraldini), and draws influence from the most innovative musical languages of the 1990s, including the "electronic" sounds of English labels like [Ninjatune](/article/en/Ninja_Tune) and [Mo' Wax](/article/en/Mo_Wax), the new rhythmic frontiers of [jungle](/article/en/jungle_music), early experiments by [Chemical Brothers](/article/en/The_Chemical_Brothers), and [downtempo](/article/en/Downtempo).

### Breakthrough: Microchip Emozionale and Sanremo (1999-2002)

In June 1999, the single "Colpo di pistola" (Gunshot) was released, anticipating the album "Microchip emozionale" (Emotional Microchip), which came out in September of the same year. Part of the new album was presented in preview at the MTV Day in Bologna, a date that marked the last live appearance of bassist Pierfunk, who was replaced by Luca "Vicio" Vicini. In October, the single "Liberi tutti" (Free Everyone) was released, created in collaboration with [Daniele Silvestri](/article/en/Daniele_Silvestri). In 2011, this song would be chosen as the musical background for the "Io voto" (I Vote) advertising campaign.

In 2000, Subsonica participated in the prestigious [Sanremo Music Festival](/article/en/Sanremo_Music_Festival) with the song "Tutti i miei sbagli" (All My Mistakes), ranking eleventh. Despite not winning, their participation significantly increased their visibility and commercial success. The reissue of "Microchip emozionale" first became a gold record and later platinum. The fourth single, "Discolabirinto" (Disco Labyrinth), was accompanied by a unique video, the first experiment in a music video compatible with an audience of hearing-impaired people. The clip, which like the song features the collaboration of [Morgan](/article/en/Marco_Castoldi) from [Bluvertigo](/article/en/Bluvertigo), was directed by Luca Pastore.

That year, they were awarded during the [MTV Europe Music Awards](/article/en/MTV_Europe_Music_Awards) in Stockholm as the best Italian artist and at the PIM (Italian Music Award) in the categories "Best Album" and "Best Group."

### Amorematico Era (2002-2004)

Preceded by the single "Nuvole rapide" (Rapid Clouds), on January 11, 2002, the album "Amorematico" was released. Within just one week, it reached number one on the Italian charts and quickly achieved gold status. For this third album, they collaborated with [Maurizio Arcieri](/article/en/Maurizio_Arcieri) and [Christina Moser](/article/en/Christina_Moser), better known as [Krisma](/article/en/Krisma), on the track "Nuova ossessione" (New Obsession) and with Roger Rama on "Nuvole rapide" and "Sole silenzioso" (Silent Sun).

On February 2, 2002, the "Amorematico Tour" started from the Velvet club in Rimini and concluded on October 11 in Bellinzona, Switzerland. A few days before the tour's conclusion, they were awarded, along with Manuel Agnelli of [Afterhours](/article/en/Afterhours_(band)), Marco Parente, and Cristina Donà, with the Grinzane Cavour Award. In November, after the release of the final single "Gente tranquilla" (Quiet People) created with Moroccan rapper Rachid, they received their second MTV Europe Music Award as Best Italian Act. A few days later, they were awarded at the Italian Music Awards for the graphic design of "Amorematico" and for the arrangement of "Nuvole Rapide." The year ended with a new platinum certification for selling 100,000 copies.

On February 7, 2003, the double live album "Controllo del livello di rombo" (Rumble Level Control) was released, recorded during the Amorematico tour. Three previously unreleased tracks were included: "Non chiedermi niente" (Don't Ask Me Anything), "Livido amniotico" (Amniotic Bruise) in collaboration with Veronika, and "L'errore" (The Mistake). A new four-month tour began, held for the first time in Italian arenas. During the date at the Mediolanum Forum in Milan, footage was shot that would become the DVD "Cielo tangenziale ovest" (West Tangential Sky) the following year.

In spring 2003, Subsonica wrote and recorded with [Linea 77](/article/en/Linea_77) the track "66 (Diabolus in musica)," which would appear on Linea 77's album "Numb." In October, "Anomalia Subsonica," the official biography written by journalist Paolo Ferrari, was published.

### Label Change: From Mescal to EMI and the Casasonica Project (2004-2006)

On January 11, 2004, they officially began working on their new album "Terrestre" (Terrestrial). On July 16, they signed a contract with EMI Italiana and simultaneously created the Casasonica label, which managed productions for several bands including Sikitikis, Cinemavolta, SteelA, Robertina, Gatto Ciliegia contro il Grande Freddo, Petrol, and LNRipley.

The change of record label was stormy: the contract with Mescal had provided for the recording of two more albums of unreleased material. The members of the group, embittered by the behavior of the independent label's managers, declared they had fulfilled their contractual obligations by presenting two new instrumental albums to Mescal, which the label considered "albums of mere noise." One of these, titled "Mentale strumentale" (Mental Instrumental), would only be released in 2020. The affair ended with mutual lawsuits. According to Samuel in interviews at the time, the move to EMI was motivated by the desire for greater artistic and economic independence.

Both labels published albums almost simultaneously: Mescal, without the group's consent, released "SUBurbani 1997-2004," while EMI released the new album "Terrestre," which came out on April 22, 2005, in two versions: CD and CD+DVD. It was anticipated by the single "Abitudine" (Habit). Later singles included "Corpo a corpo" (Body to Body) and "Incantevole" (Enchanting), which remained in the charts for more than three months and became Subsonica's best-selling single.

During the 2005/2006 biennium, two tours took place: the "Terrestre Tour" in arenas and the "Be Human Club Tour" in clubs, which registered more than 230,000 attendances across 50 dates. In November 2006, they published "Terrestre live e varie altre disfunzioni" (Terrestrial Live and Various Other Dysfunctions), a double album collecting tracks performed during the Terrestre Tour and tributes to other artists, including Gigi Restagno, Max Romeo, and Elliott Smith.

### L'eclissi and Nel vuoto per mano (2007-2009)

On October 12, 2007, "La glaciazione" (The Glaciation) was released, the first single from the new album of unreleased material titled "L'eclissi" (The Eclipse), published on November 23. The album's tour began with nine dates, starting in Jesolo on November 23 and concluding in Turin on December 12. Notably, in all tour dates, the band performed a reinterpretation of "Up Patriots to Arms" by [Franco Battiato](/article/en/Franco_Battiato), which they had first performed with Battiato himself at the Traffic festival 2007 in Turin.

In April 2008, they won the sixth edition of the Premio Amnesty Italia with the song "Canenero" (Black Dog). The award is conferred by [Amnesty International](/article/en/Amnesty_International) to recognize the best song on human rights published in the previous year.

September 14, 2008, saw the release of "Nel vuoto per mano 1997/2007" (In the Void by Hand), the first official collection of Subsonica singles, containing the unreleased single "Il vento" (The Wind) with its related video directed by Cosimo Alemà and set in Naples' Centro Direzionale skyscrapers. The second single extracted from the collection was "Strade" (Roads), presented with a video showing archival images of the group from their early days.

### Eden and Beyond (2010-2013)

In late 2010, Subsonica began teasing their sixth studio album through a series of amateur horror videos called "paraSubnormal activity (killed by marketability)," which mocked critics who had accused them of selling out to commercialism. On December 9, 2010, they released the first presentation single, "Eden," available for free download only on the first day of release, followed in January 2011 by "Istrice" (Porcupine).

For their new song "Benzina" (Gasoline), released exclusively with the monthly magazine la Repubblica XL in February 2011, Subsonica engaged in a unique collaboration with their fans. Through their official website, they asked fans to list all their "You failed to..." phrases, which would replace the old verses of the original "Benzina Ogoshi" version from the Parasubnormal Activity videos.

The album "Eden" was officially released on March 8, 2011. Subsonica promoted it with appearances at major Fnac stores across Italy and a subsequent tour. The third single from the album was "Il diluvio" (The Flood), accompanied by a high-impact video showing the band members mimicking the overwhelming force of their live performances.

### Una nave in una foresta and the Break (2014-2017)

On May 28, 2014, the band announced the release of the new single "Lazzaro" (Lazarus), set for June 6, anticipating their seventh studio album. On September 5, 2014, they announced their second single "Di domenica" (On Sunday), preceding the release of the new album "Una nave in una foresta" (A Ship in a Forest) on September 23, 2014. The album debuted at number one on the Italian chart.

The associated arena tour began on October 31, 2014, in Jesolo and concluded on December 1 at the Mediolanum Forum in Assago, after a series of sold-out performances. The "Una nave in una foresta tour" resumed in 2015 with about twenty dates and was followed by "Una foresta nei Club" (A Forest in the Clubs) in winter 2015-2016. Finally, from May 2016, they staged the 1996-2016 Tour, celebrating their 20th anniversary.

In September 2016, Samuel temporarily left the group due to health problems and personal issues, focusing on his solo album "Il codice della bellezza" (The Code of Beauty). The other musicians also agreed to pause the band's activities, with the frontman returning the following year to begin work on a new album.

### Return: 8 and Microchip temporale (2018-2019)

On May 8, 2018, the band announced the signing of a new contract with Vertigo Concerti, marking their return to the scene. On July 18, 2018, they announced the release date of their eighth studio album, simply titled "8," set for October 12, along with dates for the European reBoot 2018 tour. The first single "Bottiglie rotte" (Broken Bottles) was released on September 7, 2018, followed by "Punto critico" (Critical Point) on September 27. The album was published on October 12, 2018, with subsequent singles "Respirare" (To Breathe) and "L'incubo" (The Nightmare) following in November 2018 and March 2019 respectively.

On November 1, 2019, a new version of "Aurora sogna" (Aurora Dreams) was released, featuring collaborations with Coma Cose and Mamakass. This song anticipated the release of "Microchip temporale" (Temporal Microchip), a re-edition of the album "Microchip emozionale" celebrating its 20th anniversary. The album contained the 14 tracks of the original album, revised with new arrangements and featuring collaborations with various Italian artists including Willie Peyote, Nitro, Elisa, Motta, Lo Stato Sociale, Coez, Cosmo, Achille Lauro, Ensi, Fast Animals and Slow Kids, Myss Keta, and Gemitaiz, in addition to Coma_Cose and Mamakass.

### Recent Work: Realtà aumentata (2023-Present)

On October 20, 2023, the single "Pugno di Sabbia" (Fist of Sand) was published, anticipating the band's tenth album. On December 14, the film "Adagio" directed by Stefano Sollima was released in cinemas, featuring a soundtrack entirely created by Subsonica. Their work won the Soundtrack Stars Award 2023 for best soundtrack at the 80th Venice International Film Festival.

On December 29, 2023, the third single "Mattino di Luce" (Morning of Light) was released, accompanied by a video directed by Donato Sansone that was created with the help of generative artificial intelligence. On January 12, 2024, the album "Realtà Aumentata" (Augmented Reality) was published on the Epic Records/Sony Music label, featuring collaborations with Willie Peyote and Ensi on the song "Scoppia la bolla" (The Bubble Bursts).

On April 3, 2024, Subsonica were nominated for the 69th edition of the [David di Donatello Awards](/article/en/David_di_Donatello_Awards) in the categories of Best Original Song and Best Composer for their work on "Adagio," ultimately winning the latter award.

## Cultural Impact

Subsonica has been recognized as one of the most innovative and influential bands in the Italian music scene. Their ability to blend electronic sounds with rock elements, combined with socially conscious lyrics, has earned them both critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base. The band has consistently pushed boundaries in their music videos, live performances, and use of technology.

Their work with hearing-impaired audiences for the "Discolabirinto" video demonstrated their commitment to inclusivity, while their continuous experimentation with different musical styles has kept their sound fresh and relevant over more than two decades. The establishment of the Casasonica label also allowed them to support emerging artists within the Italian alternative scene.

In addition to their musical contributions, members of Subsonica have been involved in various social and political causes, as evidenced by their Amnesty Italia Award and tracks addressing social issues. Their soundtrack work for films like "Adagio" has further expanded their artistic reach beyond the music scene.
