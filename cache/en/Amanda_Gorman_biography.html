# None of the Above

"None of the Above" (NOTA), or "none" for short, also known as "against all" or a "scratch" vote, is a ballot option in some jurisdictions or organizations, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of all candidates in a voting system. It is based on the principle that consent requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as voters can by voting "No" on ballot questions. This option must be distinguished from [abstention](/article/en/Abstention), in which a voter does not cast a ballot at all.

NOTA is considered a form of [protest voting](/article/en/Protest_voting) and provides an official mechanism for voters to express dissatisfaction with all available candidates or options, while still participating in the electoral process.

## Implementation Around the World

Entities that include "None of the Above" on ballots as standard procedure include Argentina, Belarus, Belgium ("Не подкрепям никого", "I don't support anyone"), Colombia (voto en blanco, "blank vote"), France (vote blanc, "blank vote"), Greece (λευκό, blank), India ("None of the above"), Indonesia (kotak kosong, "empty box"), Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, North Korea, Norway, Peru, Spain (voto en blanco, "blank vote"), Uruguay, and the U.S. state of Nevada ("None of These Candidates").

Russia had such an option on its ballots (Против всех, "against all") until it was abolished in 2006. Bangladesh introduced this option (না ভোট, "no vote") in 2008. Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the 2013 Pakistan elections, but the Election Commission of Pakistan later rejected it. Beginning with the 2016 presidential election and 2017 parliamentary election, Bulgaria introduced a 'none of the above' option, which received 5.59% of the vote in the first round of the presidential elections and 4.47% in the run-off. It was also used in the 2019 mayoral election of Sofia. Kazakhstan originally included the option (Бәріне қарсымын, "against all") from 1995 to 2004, and reintroduced it from 2021 onwards, which notably received 5.8% of the vote in the 2022 presidential election.

### Impact on Election Results

When "none of the above" is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a majority or plurality of the vote, and thus "winning" the election. This possibility is not merely theoretical, as NOTA has indeed won on occasion. 

In such cases, a variety of procedures may be invoked, including:
- Having the position remain vacant
- Having the position filled by appointment
- Re-opening nominations
- Holding another election
- In some jurisdictions like India and the US state of Nevada, it may have no effect, as the next highest vote-getter wins regardless

## Implementations by Country

### Argentina

In Argentina, casting an envelope without a ballot in a ballot box counts as a [blank vote](/article/en/Blank_vote). According to the National Electoral Code, a vote is counted as blank "when the envelope is empty or with paper of any color without inscriptions or any image." Blank votes, along with affirmative votes, are considered valid votes.

There is a common misconception that "any non-affirmative vote, whether blank or null, goes to the one who comes in first" or "helps the candidate who got the most votes." The National Electoral Directorate has clarified that "the number of blank votes is not for any political group."

### Bangladesh

In 2008, Bangladesh's interim government amended election laws to allow voters to cast "no" votes (না ভোট) if they don't approve of any of the candidates. The law also states that if such "no" votes amount to 50% or more of the total votes cast, a by-election is required.

### Belgium

In Belgium, blank and null ballots together represent a significant portion of votes - 5.2% of deposited ballots in 2003, which is notably higher than the European average. Contrary to a persistent misconception, these blank and null ballots are not added to the first party; they do not factor into party vote counts or seat distribution (which is operated on validly expressed votes).

Belgium has [compulsory voting](/article/en/Compulsory_voting), which may contribute to the higher rates of blank and null votes compared to countries where abstention is a more accessible option for dissatisfied voters.

### Bulgaria

Since 2016, voters can vote for the "I do not support anyone" (Не подкрепям никого) option. These votes are excluded from the calculation of the electoral threshold. In the 2016 presidential elections, this option received 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off.

### Canada

No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists "none of the above" as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections, it is effectively possible to vote for "none of the above" by attending the polling station and formally "declining to vote." These declined votes are counted and become part of the electoral record.

Creative candidates have attempted to simulate a NOTA option through name changes. A businessman in Prince George, British Columbia ran in the 1997 federal election under the name Zznoneoff, Thea Bove (Thea Bove Zznoneoff); since ballots listed candidates alphabetically by surname, he appeared at the bottom. He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast.

Similarly, a resident of Oshawa, Ontario, formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, legally changed his name to "Above Znoneofthe", and registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal elections, most recently challenging the sitting prime minister's riding of Papineau in the 2021 Canadian federal election as the [Rhinoceros Party](/article/en/Rhinoceros_Party) candidate.

The 2020 Green Party leadership election featured a preferential ballot which allowed voters to select "none of the options" as a ranked selection.

In Ontario, the [None of the Above Party of Ontario](/article/en/None_of_the_Above_Party_of_Ontario) is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as independent representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a "reject all of the candidates" placeholder.

### Colombia

In Colombia, a NOTA option (voto en blanco, or blank vote) has been recognized by the Constitutional Court as "a political expression of dissent, abstention or inconformity with political effects" and "a valuable expression of dissent through which the electorate's will protection can be promoted." The NOTA option has been present on ballots since at least 1991.

According to Legislative Act 01 of 2009, if an election for a public corporation (such as Congress, Assemblies, or Councils), Governor, Mayor, or the first round of the presidential elections results with None of the Above receiving an absolute majority of valid ballots, the election must be repeated once with new candidates (for single-person offices) or with only the lists that had achieved the threshold for seats (for public corporations). If the blank vote is again the majority in the new election, then the candidate with the most votes is declared elected.

This system was put to the test in the 2011 regional elections for the municipality of Bello, Antioquia, where 56.7% of voters picked None of the Above, defeating the uncontested candidate and prompting a repeat election for Mayor.

### France

In France, blank voting (vote blanc) has been recognized since the [French Revolution](/article/en/French_Revolution). According to current law: "Blank ballot papers are counted separately and annexed to the minutes. They are not taken into account for the determination of the votes cast, but they are specially mentioned in the results of the ballot. An envelope containing no ballot paper is considered to be a blank ballot paper."

The blank vote is considered an act of political participation (very different from abstention where the voter does not cast a ballot, as well as from casting an invalid ballot), sending the message that "none of the options suits me," for instance in the case of a referendum.

Historically, from 1807, the dominant legal rule was the assimilation of blank voting with null voting, except for some elections during the Restoration period that counted blank votes as expressed votes. This rule was formalized for the first time in Article 30 of the regulatory decree of February 2, 1852, for the election to the Legislative Body.

Blank ballots have been counted separately and annexed to the official report since February 21, 2014. They are counted in the results of the polls and are no longer considered null votes. They are still not considered expressed votes, as they have been transformed from valid votes to invalid votes for determining relative and absolute majorities.

In France, 7.8% of voters surveyed in 2001 said they had voted blank at least once. According to available surveys, blank voters are most numerous among 25-34 year-olds; they are generally well socially integrated, belong to the favored classes, and seem distributed across all socio-professional categories. Rural blank voting seems more often to be a hidden abstention, while urban blank voting more frequently represents a political expression.

Several political organizations in France advocate for blank voting:
- The "Blanc, c'est exprimé" (Blank is Expressed) movement was created in 1989 in Brittany by Gérard Gautier.
- The Blank Vote Party (PVB) was founded in 2010 by Stéphane Guyot, aiming to have blank voting recognized in expressed votes.
- Several major political parties have integrated recognition of blank voting into their platforms, including Debout la France, MoDem, the Union populaire républicaine, and La France insoumise.

### Greece

Greece includes a blank vote (λευκό) option on ballots, allowing voters to express dissatisfaction with all candidates while still participating in the electoral process.

### India

The Election Commission of India told the Supreme Court in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a "none of the above" option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed. The [People's Union for Civil Liberties](/article/en/People's_Union_for_Civil_Liberties), a non-governmental organization, filed a public-interest litigation statement in support of this.

On September 27, 2013, the [Supreme Court of India](/article/en/Supreme_Court_of_India) ruled that the right to register a "none of the above" vote in elections should apply and ordered the Election Commission to provide such a button in the electronic voting machines, noting that it would increase participation.

The Election Commission clarified that even though votes cast as NOTA are counted, they are considered invalid votes, so they do not change the outcome of the election process. They are not taken into account for calculating the total valid votes and do not affect the forfeiture of deposit.

In the 2014 general election, NOTA polled 1.1% of the votes, amounting to over 6,000,000 votes. The specific symbol for NOTA, a ballot paper with a black cross across it, was introduced on September 18, 2015, designed by the [National Institute of Design](/article/en/National_Institute_of_Design), Ahmedabad.

### Indonesia

Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections and includes provisions for elections with only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as kotak kosong/empty box) and is declared the winner if they secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election is postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again.

There were three uncontested runs in the 2015 local elections, nine in the 2017 local elections, at least 13 in the 2018 local elections (including the mayoral elections for Tangerang and Makassar), 25 in the 2020 local elections, and 37 in the 2024 local elections.

As of 2024, three second-level local elections have resulted in NOTA "victories." In the 2018 election for mayor of Makassar, the NOTA option received over 300,000 votes, 35,000 more than the sole candidate, forcing a repeat election in 2020. In 2024, the elections for mayor of Pangkalpinang and the regent of Bangka Regency also resulted in NOTA "wins."

### Kazakhstan

In Kazakhstan, the "none of the above" (Бәріне қарсымын, "against all") option is provided in voting ballots as per Article 37(1) of the Constitutional Law "On Elections". Initially introduced in the 1991 presidential election, voters could cross out candidate names as means of choosing NOTA. The option was officially included in the election law in 1995 but removed in 2004.

Despite its removal, activists protested by casting unofficial NOTA votes and engaging in spoiled voting. In 2016, Astana lawyer Anton Fabry unsuccessfully sought a complaint to the Supreme Court, alleging that the Central Election Commission had completely neglected the interests of NOTA voters by excluding the voting option from the ballots.

During the 2021 legislative election, its absence was a significant issue, leading President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to propose reinstating it, which happened in June 2021. The NOTA option was first used again during the direct elections of rural äkims (local heads) in July 2021. In the 2022 presidential election, the NOTA option received 5.8% (460,484 votes), making it the second-largest picked option in the vote share. However, Minister of Justice Qanat Musin clarified that NOTA votes would only be considered as evidence of voter turnout, not as a determining factor due to a lack of legislation on the matter.

### Mongolia

In Mongolia, presidential elections take blank votes into account as valid votes that count in the tally of votes and their percentage. However, since a candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes (more than 50% of votes) to be elected, it is possible that no candidate reaches the required threshold, even in the second round. Such a result leads to new elections for which all parties must present new candidates. This scenario was narrowly avoided during the 2017 Mongolian presidential election when Khaltmaagiyn Battulga won in the second round by 7,332 votes, with 8.23% of voters having chosen blank voting.

### Norway

The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the parliamentary election of 2013, 12,874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank.

### Peru

In Peru, the election is canceled when two-thirds of the voters vote blank, effectively giving the people a veto right. This strong implementation of NOTA means that if a significant majority rejects all candidates, the electoral process must restart.

### Philippines

In the [Bangsamoro](/article/en/Bangsamoro) autonomous region, the Bangsamoro Electoral Code mandates a "none of the above" option on ballots and is set to be first implemented in the upcoming Bangsamoro Parliament election. It is not considered as a candidate.

However, it is unclear what would happen if the NOTA option "wins" an election. There was a proposal to remove the option altogether since if the NOTA option wins, it could leave a position vacant.

### Poland

In Poland, to be elected to the Sejm or Senate, a candidate must receive a majority of votes, including votes cast against all candidates. 

In the first democratic elections in Poland in 1989, in all districts where a single candidate from the [Polish United Workers' Party](/article/en/Polish_United_Workers'_Party) (PUWP) was nominated, voters voted "against." As a result, none of the PUWP candidates nominated for electable positions (161 seats in the Sejm and 100 in the Senate), including the incumbent Prime Minister, was elected as they did not receive a majority of votes. All elected seats, except for one Senate seat that went to a non-partisan candidate, were won by the [Solidarity movement](/article/en/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)) after by-elections.

### Russia and former Soviet Union

In the 1990 elections that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Soviet version of "none of above" (cross out voting) led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat Congress of People's Deputies. More than 100 incumbents representing the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](/article/en/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) were defeated in the run-off, leading Boris Yeltsin to later say the "none of the above" option "helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy."

In the Russian Federation, the "Against All" option was used from 1991, but was removed from ballots by decision of the [State Duma](/article/en/State_Duma) in 2006. In federal Presidential elections, it was used in 1991, 1996, 2000, and 2004. In parliamentary elections, the option was used in 1993, 1995, 1999, and 2003.

While the "Against All" candidate did not receive a significant number of votes in federal elections, its results were much better in local elections. The best result for the "Against All" candidate in Russia was recorded in 2004, when it received 65% of the votes in the election for the head of the Kurganinsky district in Krasnodar Territory.

Russian legislation established that if "Against All" received more votes than the living candidate with the highest number of votes, the election results would be annulled. For this reason, in 1999 and 2003, elections in several single-mandate districts were declared invalid. In 2006, the "Against All" option was removed, with cost savings cited as the reason, due to reduced expenses for re-elections.

In May 2014, the Russian State Duma allowed regional authorities to add the "Against All" candidate to local elections. In the 2015 elections, authorities in 6 out of 85 regions used this option.

### Serbia

In Serbia, None of the above (Ниједан од понуђених одговора, НОПО) was a parliamentary political party, founded in 2010 by Budimir Grom, which was mostly popularized on Facebook and less so on other social networking websites. In the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election, they received 22,905 votes, winning one seat in the National Assembly of Serbia.

### Spain

#### Blank Ballot
According to Spanish voting regulations, the blank ballot (voto en blanco) is recognized as 'none of the above' but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered a statistical indicator of candidatures' disapproval. Blank ballots only increase the number of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% for general elections and 5% for municipal elections) which every political party has to exceed to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the [D'Hondt method](/article/en/D'Hondt_method).

#### Blank Seats (escaños en blanco)
Since 1999, several political parties have arisen to make the 'none of the above' option visible in parliaments and force empty seats. "Blank Seats" ran for the Congress and Senate elections of November 20, 2011. Its program is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. 

According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses, or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any public funding.

By voting for such an option at the local elections in May 2011, citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foixà (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively. Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes).

The [Ciudadanos En Blanco](/article/en/Ciudadanos_En_Blanco) (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved.

### Switzerland

Since 2003, Switzerland has counted blank ballots in majority elections. They participate in establishing the absolute majority, but in the second round, a relative majority is applied.

Since 2014, citizen collectives, notably led by Thomas Wroblevski in the canton of Neuchâtel and Jean-Luc Berkovits in the canton of Vaud, have been advocating for institutional recognition of blank voting in Switzerland. These groups have presented symbolic lists in municipal, cantonal, and federal elections, sometimes under the banner of the Modernokratie collective, to represent voters who reject the proposed candidates. They demand that blank voting be recognized as a legitimate political choice, capable of leading, in case of a majority, to a vacant seat or a new election, thus giving an effective role of democratic veto.

### Tunisia

In Tunisia, during the elections of members of the constituent assembly in October 2011, blank votes were counted for determining the number of seats obtained by electoral lists in certain constituencies. However, an appeal was filed in the Medenine constituency by the [Ennahdha party](/article/en/Ennahdha) to cancel this decision and not take blank votes into account. The administrative court accepted the appeal and allowed the Ennahdha party to win an additional seat.

### Ukraine

Ukraine includes an "against all" option on ballots, allowing voters to express dissatisfaction with all candidates. This system is similar to that used in Russia before 2006.

During the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to Vasily Protyvsih (Vasily Against-all) to represent the sentiment of voters who wished to vote against all candidates.

### United Kingdom

UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including 'rejected' votes. 'Rejected votes' are classified into four categories, with protest votes recorded alongside others rejected as 'voter's intention uncertain'.

#### NOTA UK
NOTA UK is a voluntary organization set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions to the parliamentary Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee (PCRC) making the case for NOTA 'with teeth', i.e., formalized consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA 'win'.

As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published in February 2015, that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. No public consultation materialized as the incoming Conservative majority government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.

Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK's lobbying, it has been a policy of the [Green Party of England and Wales](/article/en/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales) to get a form of NOTA (RON – Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers.

#### Above and Beyond Party
The Above and Beyond Party was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the 2015 general election, none of whom were elected. Their sole stated policy was to introduce a "none of the above" option on all UK ballot papers. The party was de-registered by the Electoral Commission on November 3, 2016.

#### No Candidate Deserves My Vote! Party
No Candidate Deserves My Vote! was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on November 23, 2000. The party's single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a "none of the above" option added to every local and general election ballot paper. If a candidate wins an election, it is the intention to stay as a Member of Parliament until the change in the law is enacted, after which the candidate will step down and the party will be disbanded.

The party proposes that if NOTA gains the majority vote, it should trigger an automatic by-election, indicating a vote of no confidence in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for.

In 2010, Stephen Phillips of Stevenage stood in the UK general election on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote. Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates.

#### NOTA Party
The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on March 2, 2009. It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes; this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote.

The party was registered as 'NOTA' and not 'None of the Above' as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name. A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission on the grounds that the acronym 'NOTA' is as good as the phrase 'None of the Above'.

#### Other UK Initiatives
Various individuals have changed their names by deed poll to appear on ballots as "None of the Above" or similar variations:
- Terry Marsh changed his name to "None Of The Above X" to run in South Basildon and East Thurrock in 2010
- Another individual changed his name to "None Of The Above" to stand in Chingford and Woodford Green in 2010
- Zero, None Of The Above (formerly Eric Mutch) was a candidate in the 2010 general election in Filton and Bradley Stoke

The South Wales Anarchists group has run a campaign urging people to "Vote Nobody" since 2008, and many other anarchist groups worldwide have promoted similar slogans.

The [Landless Peasant Party](/article/en/Landless_Peasant_Party), whose leader Derek Jackson gained publicity for standing against then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his home constituency in the 2010 elections, includes a pledge to add a "None of the above" option to the ballot in all UK elections.

### United States

The origins of the ballot option "None of the Above" in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted "None of These Candidates" as a ballot option in 1976. In some United States presidential primaries, individuals can vote for unpledged delegates by voting Uncommitted. "None of the above" is also permitted in the bylaws of the [Libertarian Party](/article/en/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)), with NOTA winning the 2024 Libertarian Party presidential primaries in North Carolina and Massachusetts.

In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the "None of the Above Act," qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State, but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%. Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the "none of the above" voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes.

Other notable examples of NOTA-related initiatives in the United States include:
- In 2000, [Michael Moore](/article/en/Michael_Moore) advocated a write-in candidate Ficus (the plant) for Congress as a unified vote for none of the above in congressional seats where the incumbent was running unopposed.
- David Gatchell of Tennessee ran for governor in 2002 and for Senate in 2006 as a protest, officially changing his middle name from Leroy to None of the Above. In 2006, he got 3,738 votes (0.2 percent).

## Procedures that Function Like "None of the Above"

Most ballots do not have a formal "none of the above" option, but some have procedures that work in a similar way:

### Re-open Nominations (RON)
Many students' unions in Britain, Ireland, and elsewhere use a similar ballot option called 're-open nominations' (RON) in IRV and single transferable vote (STV) elections. These include the [National Union of Students](/article/en/National_Union_of_Students_of_the_United_Kingdom) in the UK and UCD Student's Union in Ireland. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP (first-past-the-post) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election.

RON is not strictly a none of the above candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist.

### Illegal Ballots in Robert's Rules of Order
The American [Robert's Rules of Order](/article/en/Robert's_Rules_of_Order), Newly Revised (RONR) describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots that do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as "scrap paper", and are of no effect, but "unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters… are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority." 

RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. "The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion."

### No Award
Voting for the [Hugo Awards](/article/en/Hugo_Award) is by [instant runoff voting](/article/en/Instant-runoff_voting), in which nominees for a category are ranked. There are normally seven options: six nominees, plus "No Award". A first preference vote for no award implies that the voter believes that either the category should be abolished, or that none of the nominees are worthy of an award. A second or subsequent preference implies that any higher-ranked nominees are worthy of an award, while those ranked lower are not.

## Cultural References

In the film [Brewster's Millions](/article/en/Brewster's_Millions_(1985_film)), the protagonist Brewster (played by Richard Pryor) is required, under certain conditions, to spend $30,000,000 in thirty days in order to inherit $300,000,000. After failing to lose money through gambling and inadvisable investments, he joins the race for Mayor of New York City and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging voters to support None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor's goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his "None of the Above" campaign became so popular.

In the sixth-season episode of [Captain Planet](/article/en/Captain_Planet_and_the_Planeteers) called "Dirty Politics," three of the Eco-Villains are running for president and kidnap the fourth candidate, who is the most popular. Despite this, over seventy percent vote None of the Above, resulting in the need for a new election.

L. Neil Smith's novel [The Probability Broach](/article/en/The_Probability_Broach) has an alternate history in which the United States becomes a libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, where None of the Above (which is always an option on the ballot) has received the most votes for President of the North American Confederacy on two occasions. The first time was in 1968, defeating Lucy Kropotkin by only one vote and would serve until 1972 as the NAC's 24th President. The second time was in 2000 and again in 2004, being elected "President for Life" in 2008, serving as the 28th President and essentially abolishing the presidency.
