# Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid

Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid, DBE (Arabic: زها حديد, DMG Zahā Ḥadīd; October 31, 1950 – March 31, 2016) was an Iraqi-British architect, artist, and designer. She is recognized as a key figure in the architecture of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Born in Baghdad, Iraq, Hadid studied mathematics as an undergraduate and later enrolled at the [Architectural Association School of Architecture](/article/en/Architectural_Association_School_of_Architecture) in 1972. In search of an alternative to traditional architectural drawing, and influenced by [Suprematism](/article/en/Suprematism) and the Russian avant-garde, Hadid adopted painting as a design tool and abstraction as a method to "reinvestigate the aborted and untested experiments of Modernism [...] to unveil new fields of building."

She was described by [The Guardian](/article/en/The_Guardian) as the "Queen of Curves," who "liberated architectural geometry, giving it a whole new expressive identity." Her major works include the [London Aquatics Centre](/article/en/London_Aquatics_Centre) for the 2012 Olympics, the [Broad Art Museum](/article/en/Eli_and_Edythe_Broad_Art_Museum), Rome's [MAXXI Museum](/article/en/MAXXI_National_Museum_of_21st_Century_Arts), and the [Guangzhou Opera House](/article/en/Guangzhou_Opera_House). Some of her awards have been presented posthumously, including the statuette for the 2017 [Brit Awards](/article/en/Brit_Awards). She was also recognized by the 2013 Forbes List as one of the "World's Most Powerful Women." Several of her buildings were still under construction at the time of her death, including the [Daxing International Airport](/article/en/Beijing_Daxing_International_Airport) in Beijing and the [Al Janoub Stadium](/article/en/Al_Janoub_Stadium) in Qatar, a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Hadid was the first woman to receive the [Pritzker Architecture Prize](/article/en/Pritzker_Architecture_Prize), in 2004. She also received the UK's most prestigious architectural award, the [Stirling Prize](/article/en/Stirling_Prize), in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to architecture, and in February 2016, the month before her death, she became the first woman to be individually awarded the [Royal Gold Medal](/article/en/Royal_Gold_Medal) from the [Royal Institute of British Architects](/article/en/Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects) (Ray Eames and Sheila O'Donnell had previously received it jointly with Charles Eames and John Tuomey respectively).

## Early Life and Family

Zaha Hadid was born on October 31, 1950, in Baghdad, Iraq, to an upper-class Iraqi family. Her father, Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid, was a wealthy industrialist from [Mosul](/article/en/Mosul). He co-founded the socialist al-Ahali group in 1932, a significant political organization in the 1930s and 1940s. He also co-founded the [National Democratic Party](/article/en/National_Democratic_Party_(Iraq)) in Iraq and served as minister of finance after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état, under the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim. Her mother, Wajiha al-Sabunji, was an artist from Mosul, who taught Hadid how to draw and had excellent taste and a sharp eye for beautiful forms (ar). Her brother, Foulath Hadid, was a writer, accountant, and expert on Arab affairs.

In an interview, Hadid recalled that early childhood trips to the ancient [Sumerian](/article/en/Sumer) cities in southern Iraq sparked her interest in architecture. She said: "My father took us to visit the Sumerian cities. We went by boat and then continued in a smaller boat made of reed bundles. The beauty of the landscapes there, with sand, water, birds, buildings, and people, has remained in my memory since that moment. I am trying to discover, or invent, an architectural style and forms of urban planning that have the same effect, but in a more modern way" (ar).

Hadid received her primary and secondary education at the National Nuns' School in Baghdad, which she described as having a diverse student body: "I attended the nuns' school in Baghdad. I was a Muslim girl in the convent, and there were Jewish girls too. We were required to go to church and pray there." She added that when she returned home, she would ask her father why they didn't pray like the others, and her father told her that they were not Christians, so they didn't have to go to church (ar). 

At the age of six, her parents took her to an exhibition by [Frank Lloyd Wright](/article/en/Frank_Lloyd_Wright) at the Opera House in Baghdad, where she was very impressed by the forms she saw. By the age of eleven, Hadid had determined her interest in becoming an architect, designed her room's decor, and observed architectural designs of buildings (ar).

In the 1960s, she attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland. At the age of sixteen, she began studying outside of Iraq (ar).

## Education

Hadid studied mathematics at the [American University of Beirut](/article/en/American_University_of_Beirut) between 1968 and 1971. In 1972, she moved to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where she studied with [Rem Koolhaas](/article/en/Rem_Koolhaas), [Elia Zenghelis](/article/en/Elia_Zenghelis), and [Bernard Tschumi](/article/en/Bernard_Tschumi). 

Her former professor Koolhaas described her at graduation as "a planet in her own orbit" (de). Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught: "We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces." He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases: "The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling. She couldn't care about tiny details. Her mind was on the broader picture—when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later. She was right."

Her AA graduation thesis, "Malevich's Tektonik," was a concept and design for a 14-level hotel on London's [Hungerford Bridge](/article/en/Hungerford_Bridge) executed as an acrylic painting, inspired by the works of the Ukrainian Suprematist artist [Kazimir Malevich](/article/en/Kazimir_Malevich).

## Career

### Early Professional Years

After graduation in 1977, she went to work for her former professors, Koolhaas and Zenghelis, at the [Office for Metropolitan Architecture](/article/en/Office_for_Metropolitan_Architecture) (OMA) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Through her association with Koolhaas, she met the architectural engineer [Peter Rice](/article/en/Peter_Rice), who supported and encouraged her during the early stages of her career. 

Hadid became a naturalized citizen of the United Kingdom. She opened her own architectural firm, [Zaha Hadid Architects](/article/en/Zaha_Hadid_Architects), in London in 1980. During the early 1980s, Hadid introduced audiences to a new modern architectural style through her highly detailed and professional sketches. At a time when architectural focus was shifting toward [postmodernism](/article/en/Postmodern_architecture), her approach stood out and set her apart from other designers.

She then began her teaching career at the Architectural Association and later held positions at the [Harvard Graduate School of Design](/article/en/Harvard_Graduate_School_of_Design) (Kenzo Tange Chair), [Cambridge University](/article/en/University_of_Cambridge), the [University of Chicago](/article/en/University_of_Chicago), the [Hochschule für bildende Künste](/article/en/Hamburg_University_of_Fine_Arts) in Hamburg, the [University of Illinois at Chicago](/article/en/University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago) (Sullivan Chair), and [Columbia University](/article/en/Columbia_University). From 2000 until her emeritus status in 2015, Hadid held a professorship at the Institute of Architecture at the [University of Applied Arts Vienna](/article/en/University_of_Applied_Arts_Vienna), where she directed the studio hadid, vienna (de).

She earned her early reputation through lecturing and radical, colorful designs and projects, which were widely published in architectural journals but largely remained unbuilt. Her ambitious but unrealized projects included The Peak in Hong Kong (1983) and a plan for an opera house in Cardiff, Wales (1994). She became well-known through the Peak Leisure Club architectural design competition in 1983, a competition for a luxury club planned for construction on Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. With Arata Isozaki's recommendation, Zaha won first place, but her design—which resembled countless sharp fragments of an exploded building suspended in mid-air—was never built as the developer went bankrupt shortly after the competition (ja).

The Cardiff experience was particularly discouraging: although her design was selected as the best by the competition jury, the Millennium Commission, acting as funding body, refused to support it, and the project was awarded to another architect. Hadid responded to the decision by asking "Do they want nothing but mediocrity?" Her reputation during this period rested largely on her teaching and the imaginative, vibrant paintings she made of her proposed buildings.

Her international profile rose significantly in 1988 when she was selected as one of seven architects featured in the "Deconstructivism in Architecture" exhibition curated by [Philip Johnson](/article/en/Philip_Johnson) and [Mark Wigley](/article/en/Mark_Wigley) at New York's [Museum of Modern Art](/article/en/Museum_of_Modern_Art). That exhibition, along with a conference at the [Tate](/article/en/Tate) in London and increased press coverage, helped establish her name globally and allowed her work to be associated with a distinct architectural style.

### Early Buildings (1991–2005)

#### Vitra Fire Station, Weil am Rhein, Germany (1991–1993)

One of her first clients was Rolf Fehlbaum, the president-director general of the Swiss furniture firm [Vitra](/article/en/Vitra_(company)), and later, from 2004 to 2010, a member of the jury for the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 1989, Fehlbaum had invited [Frank Gehry](/article/en/Frank_Gehry), then little-known, to build a design museum at the Vitra factory in [Weil am Rhein](/article/en/Weil_am_Rhein). In 1993, he invited Hadid to design a small fire station for the factory. 

Her design, made of raw concrete and glass, was a sculptural work composed of sharp diagonal forms colliding together in the center. The design plans appeared in architecture magazines before construction. When completed, it only served as a fire station for a short period of time, as Weil am Rhein soon opened their own fire station. It became an exhibit space instead, and is now on display with the works of Gehry and other well-known architects. It was the launching pad of her architectural career.

The Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein is one of Zaha Hadid's first works that significantly contributed to her global fame. It was met with severe criticism, and the design was described as ugly, with not even a single window. The station's design showcases her style in using polygonal and triangular constructions, slicing through space, and creating a sense of constant movement. The building was described in architectural circles as an expression of a complete construction resembling ready-made fire extinguishers that could explode at any moment (ar).

Hadid took pride in her design for this station because it was her first building. She considered Rolf Fehlbaum, the station's president, a true patron when he had the courage to give her that opportunity without seeing any record of her work and without being certain of its popular success (ar).

#### Bergisel Ski Jump, Innsbruck, Austria (1999–2002)

Hadid designed a public housing estate in Berlin (1986–1993) and organized an exhibition, "The Great Utopia" (1992), at the [Guggenheim Museum](/article/en/Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum) in New York. Her next major project was a ski jump at [Bergisel](/article/en/Bergisel), in Innsbruck, Austria. The old ski jump, built in 1926, had been used in the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics. The new structure was to contain not only a ski jump but also a cafe with 150 seats offering a 360-degree view of the mountains. Hadid had to fight against traditionalists and against time; the project had to be completed in one year, before the next international competition. Her design is 48 meters high and rests on a base seven meters by seven meters. She described it as "an organic hybrid," a cross between a bridge and a tower, which by its form gives a sense of movement and speed.

In December 1999, Zaha Hadid won the international competition for the new ski jump at Mount Bergisel in Innsbruck. It was opened in 2002. This project is a distinctive landmark in the city and one of the important tourist attractions. It is part of a project to renovate the Olympic arena, which no longer complied with international standards. The platform had existed since the 1960s, when the Winter Olympic Games were held there. However, there was a desire to renovate it to become a completely different new platform from its predecessor. The building contains a mix of international sports facilities, a café, a restaurant, and a viewing terrace. These different elements unite in a new single formation, which enjoys high fluidity and harmonizes with the layers of earth on which it was built. It extends on the slopes of the land to the top of the mountain, along about 90 meters and a height of 50 meters (ar).

#### Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States (1997–2003)

At the end of the 1990s, her career began to gather momentum, as she won commissions for two museums and a large industrial building. She competed against Rem Koolhaas and other well-known architects for the design of the [Contemporary Arts Center](/article/en/Contemporary_Arts_Center_(Cincinnati)) in Cincinnati, Ohio (1997–2003). She won, and became the first woman to design an art museum in the United States. At 8,500 square meters, the museum was not huge, and her design did not have the flamboyance of the [Guggenheim Bilbao](/article/en/Guggenheim_Museum_Bilbao) of Frank Gehry, built at the same time. But the project demonstrated Hadid's ability to use architectural forms to create interior drama, including its central element, a 30-meter-long black stairway that passes between massive curving and angular concrete walls.

The Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati was established in 1993 and is one of the oldest institutions dedicated to visual arts in the United States. In 1997, Hadid won a competition to design the new building for the center in the commercial district of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, which became her first building in America. The design of this building was considered one of the first designs that adopted the deconstructive method, as the construction of the building in that way and style was not common at that time, and it received widespread criticism, but it was ultimately approved and completed in 2003 (ar).

#### Spittelau Viaducts Housing Project, Vienna, Austria (1994–2005)

In 1994, Hadid was commissioned by the city of Vienna to design and construct a three-part scheme for the urban redevelopment of an area adjacent to the Danube Canal. Situated along the Spittelauer Lände, the series of buildings interact with and cross over the railway viaduct by Viennese Modernist architect [Otto Wagner](/article/en/Otto_Wagner), a protected structure. In its initial design consisting of five buildings, the mixed-use scheme, described as a "sculpture-like overbuilding" of the historic Stadtbahn railway, was designed by Hadid's practice ZHA. Hadid, together with British architectural artist [Brian Clarke](/article/en/Brian_Clarke), developed an unexecuted collaborative proposal for the project that incorporated integral artworks by Clarke as part of the Neo-Futurist structures, with interrelated glass mosaic and traditionally-leaded stained glass forming part of the cladding and fenestration of the complex. Clarke developed a new type of mouth-blown glass for the scheme, which he christened 'Zaha-Glas'. Later reduced to three buildings, the project, which experienced delays in construction, was completed in 2006, without the artwork.

#### Phaeno Science Center, Wolfsburg, Germany (2000–2005)

In 2000, she won an international competition for the [Phaeno Science Center](/article/en/Phaeno_Science_Center), in Wolfsburg, Germany (2002–2005). The new museum was only a little larger than the Cincinnati Museum, with 9,000 square meters of space, but the plan was much more ambitious. It was similar in concept to the buildings of [Le Corbusier](/article/en/Le_Corbusier), raised up seven meters on concrete pylons. Unlike Corbusier's buildings, she planned for the space under the building to be filled with activity, and each of the 10 massive inverted cone-shaped columns that hold up the building contains a cafe, a shop, or a museum entrance. The tilting columns reach up through the building and also support the roof. The museum structure resembles an enormous ship, with sloping walls and asymmetric scatterings of windows, and the interior, with its angular columns and exposed steel roof framework, gives the illusion of being inside a working vessel or laboratory.

The Phaeno Science Center is one of the architectural works of Zaha Hadid, located in Wolfsburg, Germany, and was completed in 2005. In January 2000, an international jury awarded Zaha Hadid the first prize in a competition to design the Science Center in Wolfsburg, Germany, on a 12,000 square meter plot of land. It is one of the first science centers in Germany and is characterized by its unique and modern design (ar).

It is the first center of its kind in Germany, and it appears as something mysterious that drives curiosity and discovery; it is a project that combined classical and engineering complexity, and at the same time bold design and the adoption of original materials, where the entire building was raised on columns, allowing for public passage underneath (ar).

#### BMW Administration Building, Leipzig, Germany (2001–2005)

In 2002, she won the competition to design a new administrative building for the factory of the auto manufacturer [BMW](/article/en/BMW) in Leipzig, Germany. The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the "nerve center" of the complex. As with the Phaeno Science Center, the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete beams and a roof supported by steel beams in the shape of an 'H'. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid "the traditional segregation of working groups" and to show the "global transparence of the internal organization" of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of "transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own."

The BMW Central Building is one of Hadid's architectural works in the northern section of the city of Leipzig, Germany. Hadid won its design in 2001, and construction began in 2003 until its completion in 2005. The building was designed so that its area could be increased horizontally in the future, due to its containing spaces between its sections that are suitable for construction. The building consists of three different sections separated from each other, connected only by corridors that have a specific function when construction is completed. Each section was designed to play a designated role in the production process and manufacturing of the company's cars. The first building is a section dedicated to manufacturing car bodies; the second section is a workshop specialized in painting cars; and the third section is a place for assembling cars (ar).

#### Ordrupgaard Museum extension, Copenhagen, Denmark (2001–2005)

In 2001, she began another museum project, an extension of the [Ordrupgaard Museum](/article/en/Ordrupgaard) near Copenhagen, Denmark, a museum featuring a collection of 19th century French and Danish art in the 19th-century mansion of its collector. The new building is 87 meters long and 20 meters wide, and is connected by a five-meter wide passage to the old museum. There are no right angles – only diagonals – in the concrete shell of the museum. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls of the gallery make the garden the backdrop of the exhibits.

#### Pritzker Architecture Prize

In 2004, she won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the most prestigious award in architecture, though she had only completed four buildings – the Vitra Fire Station, the Ski Lift in Innsbruck Austria, the Car Park and Terminus Hoenheim North in France, and the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati. In making the announcement, Thomas Pritzker, the head of the jury, announced: "Although her body of work is relatively small, she has achieved great acclaim and her energy and ideas show even greater promise for the future."

### Major Projects (2006–2010)

#### Zaragoza Bridge Pavilion, Zaragoza, Spain (2005–2008)

Between 1997 and 2010, Hadid ventured into the engineers' domain of bridge construction, a field also occupied by other top architects including [Norman Foster](/article/en/Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank) and [Santiago Calatrava](/article/en/Santiago_Calatrava). Between 2005 and 2008, she designed and built the Bridge-Pavilion of Zaragoza, which was both an exhibit hall and a bridge, created for Expo 2008, an event on the themes of water and durable development. The concrete bridge span on which the pavilion rests is 85 meters long, as measured from the Exposition site to an island in the Ebro River. The bridge carries or is attached to four tunnel-like exhibition spaces she termed "pods," which spread onto the island, for a total length of 275 meters. The pods are covered with a skin of 26,000 triangular shingles, many of which open to let in air and light. The bridge-pavilion, characteristic of her designs and buildings of the period, is composed entirely of diagonal slopes and curves, with no right-angles of orthogonal forms. By its curving shape and low profile, the bridge-pavilion fits smoothly into the grassy landscape along the river.

The Bridge Pavilion is a bridge located in the city of Zaragoza in the Aragon region of Spain, and is the third bridge to cross the Ebro River in Zaragoza from west to east. It was built in 2008 by Hadid in preparation for Expo 2008. It is 260 meters long, with a maximum height of 30 meters, sometimes reaching 15 meters, while its width is 30 meters in some sections and 8 meters in others. The longest distance between columns reaches 165 meters. The area of the corridors alone is 7000 square meters, while the structure of the bridge is made of iron. Its external shape was inspired by a shark. The natural atmosphere inside the building is due to the movement of air allowed by the openings in the structure, where it becomes like a cooling system (ar).

#### Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (1997–2010)

Between 1997 and 2010, she constructed a much more ambitious bridge, the [Sheikh Zayed Bridge](/article/en/Sheikh_Zayed_Bridge), which honors Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, between the island of Abu Dhabi and the mainland of Abu Dhabi, as well as to the Abu Dhabi International Airport. Both the design of the bridge and the lighting, consisting of gradually changing colors, were designed to give the impression of movement. The silhouette of the bridge is a wave, with a principal arch 235 meters long, standing 60 meters above the water. The total span of four lanes is 842 meters (2,762 feet) long, and also includes pedestrian walkways. The bridge was inaugurated on 25 November 2010, by the late UAE President Sheikh Khalifa. The ceremony was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, marking her second state visit to the UAE. Traffic on the bridge commenced three days following the opening ceremony.

In 1967, an iron bridge was built to connect the city of Abu Dhabi, built on an island, to the mainland; in the seventies, the second bridge was built to connect the southern part of the island. The construction of both bridges is due to the heavy reliance of the Emirates society on the use of cars, which in turn requires a new road around the southern Gulf coast to connect the Emirates to each other. In 1997, Zaha Hadid won a design competition for the Sheikh Zayed Bridge, which is an arch bridge. It was named after the founder of the country, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The design idea of the bridge appears to be gathering a group of structure braids on one shore, which rise and rush over the canal. The bridge is a curve that resembles the shape of a wave. The main arch of the bridge rises about 60 meters above the water level and reaches 20 meters at the end, with a length of 842 meters (ar).

#### National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI), Rome, Italy (1998–2010)

The [National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century](/article/en/MAXXI_National_Museum_of_21st_Century_Arts) (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was designed and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture is the sense of movement; everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. Hadid took inspiration from the surrounding orthogonal site grids to determine the overall form. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white color scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called "confluence, interference and turbulence."

The MAXXI – Museum of 21st Century Arts in Rome is the first national museum of contemporary art in Italy. This new institution was established by a decision from the Italian Parliament and Ministry of Culture, as Rome's projects were characterized by antiquity and classicism, but the implementation of the work, which departed from the known framework, was for a political motive. The building design was the first step in creating the institution. It was inspired by the lines and heritage of the city to twin with the atmosphere of the capital. A large urban site was allocated for the building in the Flaminia district on the northern edge of Rome's historic center. The implementation of the huge building project, about 21 thousand square meters, required more than six years of continuous work until it was completed. It was opened in Rome at the end of 2009. The work cost 150 million euros, according to the Spanish newspaper El País (ar).

The center is divided from the outside into two main sections, perpendicular to each other, but they meet at a point of contact between them. Inside, there are many branches where there is no consistency between the halls and stairs. The building is made of concrete with its roof covered with transparent reflective glass that allows light to penetrate and spread in the place, as well as reflecting on the paintings, forming a view that gives the place an atmosphere of elegance resulting from the reflection of the sun on the glass. The center is concerned with two types of arts; the first is architectural designs and paintings; the second type is displaying artistic artifacts of high cultural and creative value. In addition to being a center for exchanging information between people, it includes spaces for permanent and temporary exhibitions, an architectural center, a conference center, and a library (ar).

#### Guangzhou Opera House, Guangzhou, China (2003–2010)

In 2002 Hadid won an international competition for her first project in China. The [Guangzhou Opera House](/article/en/Guangzhou_Opera_House) is located in a new business district of the city, with a new 103-story glass tower behind it. It covers 70,000 square meters and was built at cost of US$300 million. The complex comprises an 1,800-seat theater, a multipurpose theater, entry hall, and salon. A covered pathway with restaurants and shops separates the two main structures. This building, like several of her later buildings, was inspired by natural earth forms; the architect herself referred to it as the "two pebbles." It appears akin to two giant smooth-edged boulders faced with 75,000 panels of polished granite and glass. Edwin Heathcote, writing for the [Financial Times](/article/en/Financial_Times), noted Hadid's concentration on how her design could transform the urban landscape of Guangzhou, as the building rose as the center of the new business area. He wrote in 2011 that Hadid "produced a building that seems to suck the surrounding landscape into a vortex of movement and swirling space... appears both as alien object in a landscape of incomprehensible vastness (and often overwhelming banality), and as an extrusion of the peculiar nature of this landscape." Nicolai Ourousoff, architecture critic of the [New York Times](/article/en/The_New_York_Times), wrote that "stepping into the main hall is like entering the soft insides of an oyster...The concave ceiling is pierced by thousands of little lights—it looks like you're sitting under the dome of a clear night sky." Ourousoff noted that the finished building had construction problems: many of the granite tiles on the exterior had to be replaced, and the plaster and other interior work was poorly done by the inexperienced workers, but he praised Hadid's ability "to convey a sense of bodies in motion" and called the building "a Chinese gem that elevates its setting."

The Guangzhou Opera House is a Chinese opera house and the largest performing arts center in southern China. It was opened in Guangzhou, China, in 2010, becoming the largest opera house in southern China and the third largest opera house in China after the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing and the Shanghai Grand Theatre. The project extends over an area of 70,000 square meters in the heart of Guangzhou. Hadid's design, called the "double pebble," won the right to build the house, and the foundation stone was laid early in 2005. The total cost of the project was 1.38 billion yuan, approximately 200 million US dollars (ar).

The design consists of two main blocks. The opera house is located near the Pearl River, so Hadid drew inspiration for the amazing shape of the opera from the shapes of pebbles that lie on the banks of the river, and drew the fluidity of its external design from the influence of wind and water on rocks to make it appear as if they had carved the building. As strange as the building is from the outside, it is equally exceptionally beautiful on the inside; Hadid wanted, through this extreme fluidity, to represent the effects of river carving in valleys. The main hall in the house accommodates 1,800 people, and next to it is a smaller multi-purpose hall that seats 400 for opera performances and plays (ar).

The interior design relies on natural lighting that enters through triangular windows skillfully distributed for the greatest benefit from natural lighting. Wherever you look inside or outside the building, you will feel Zaha Hadid's usual imprint in the smooth flowing lines that harmonize with each other in wonderful consistency (ar).

### Major Projects (2011–2012)

#### Riverside Museum, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom (2004–2011)

The [Riverside Museum](/article/en/Riverside_Museum) (2004–2011), on the banks of the River Clyde Glasgow, Scotland, houses the Glasgow Museum of Transport. Hadid described the 10,000-square meter building, with 7,000 square meters of gallery space, as "a wave," "folds in movement," and "a shed in the form of a tunnel, open at the extreme ends, one end toward the city and the other toward the Clyde." Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with zinc plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles. The interior galleries caused some controversy; visitors who came to see the collection of historic automobiles found that they are mounted on the walls, high overhead, so it is impossible to look into them. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London wrote: "Obviously the space is about movement...Outside it is, typologically, a supermarket, being a big thing in a parking lot that is seeking to attract you in...It has enigma and majesty, but not friendliness."

The Riverside Museum in Glasgow, Scotland, is one of the most modern cultural buildings designed by Hadid, and was officially opened on June 20, 2011. The museum replaced the Glasgow Museum of Transport, which moved to Kelvin Hall. The museum overlooks the River Clyde with its polished facade rising 36 meters, and its undulating zinc-clad roof. The structure of the building is made of solid steel, and it was built on the site of an old shipyard. It features a spacious exhibition area of seven thousand square meters, free of supporting columns. It cost $106 million to build. On May 18, 2013, it was announced that the museum had won the European Museum of the Year Award for that year (ar).

#### CMA CGM Tower, Marseille, France (2006–2011)

Hadid's first built tower, the [CMA CGM Tower](/article/en/CMA_CGM_Tower) in Marseille, France, is most immediately notable for its dual vertical form. According to Zaha Hadid Architects, "The curving profiles on the exterior facades work with the central core of the building, bringing a rigid frame and a sense of movement to this completely new typology of tower." The 94,000-square meter building, which resembles a ship's prow, is the highest in the town at 147 m and has a capacity of 2700 desks, an 800-seat company restaurant, a 190-seat auditorium, a maritime museum, a fitness room and training rooms.

CMA CGM, the largest shipping company in France, chose the design submitted by Hadid in 2005 to be its headquarters in Marseille, southern France. This tower is 110 meters tall. Hadid made the tower from glass, cement, and steel, where glass panels meet in the form of two arches forming the geometric element. It consists of 25 floors to accommodate all the company's employees, more than 1600 employees, in addition to a training center, sports halls, and a restaurant on the top floor (ar).

#### London Olympics Aquatics Centre, London, United Kingdom (2005–2011)

Hadid described her [Aquatics Centre](/article/en/London_Aquatics_Centre) for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as "inspired by the fluid geometry of water in movement." The building covers three swimming pools, and seats 17,500 spectators at the two main pools. The roof, made of steel and aluminum and covered with wood on the inside, rests on just three supports; it is in the form of a parabolic arch that dips in the center, with the two pools at either end. The seats are placed in bays beside the curving and outward-leaning walls of glass. At £269 million, the complex cost three times the original estimate, owing principally to the complexity of the roof. This was the subject of much comment when it was constructed, and it was the first 2012 Olympic building begun but the last to be finished. It was praised by architecture critics. Rowan Moore of The Guardian said that the roof "floats and undulates" and called the center "the Olympics' most majestic space."

The London Aquatics Centre is one of Hadid's architectural works, located in the Olympic Park in London. Its construction began in 2008 and was completed in 2011. This building expresses the movement of water in an amazing way, where the entire composition appears to be a drop of water in a constant state of motion, and it creates spaces that resemble the river environment. The building was designed to meet the needs of the London 2012 Olympic Games with a capacity of 17,500 spectators. The three swimming pools were placed on one axis, with the training pool placed under a bridge, while the other pools were left within the basic coverage of the building (ar).

#### Broad Art Museum, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States (2007–2012)

The [Broad Art Museum](/article/en/Eli_and_Edythe_Broad_Art_Museum) at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, Hadid's second project in the United States, has a space of 4,274 square meters, dedicated to contemporary art and modern art and an historical collection. The parallelogram-shaped building leans sharply and seems about to tip over. Hadid wrote that she designed the building so that its sloping pleated stainless steel facades would reflect the surrounding neighborhood from different angles; the building continually changes color depending upon the weather, the time of day and the angle of the sun. As Hadid commented, the building "awakens curiosity without ever truly revealing its contents." Elaine Glusac of The New York Times wrote that the architecture of the new museum "radicalizes the streetscape." The Museum was used in a scene of the 2016 Batman vs. Superman movie.

The Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum is a museum of contemporary art at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. It was opened on November 10, 2012 (ar).

#### Galaxy SOHO, Beijing, China (2008–2012)

Many of Hadid's later major works are found in Asia. The [Galaxy SOHO](/article/en/Galaxy_SOHO) in Beijing, China (2008–2012) is a combination of offices and a commercial center in the heart of Beijing with a total of 332,857 square meters, composed of four different ovoid glass-capped buildings joined by multiple curving passageways on different levels. Hadid explained, "the interior spaces follow the same coherent formal logic of continual curvilinearity." The complex, like most of her buildings, gives the impression that every part of them is in motion.

The Soho Galaxy building or Soho Galaxy in the capital Beijing. It is a huge white-faced building, reaching nearly two hundred feet in length and 538,000 square feet in volume. It was opened in 2012. It was nominated by the Royal Institute of British Architects for the Lubetkin Prize for 2013, for her design of the Soho Galaxy building, where this prize is awarded to architects who have a leading role in presenting visual ideas for urban issues. The building faced sharp criticism due to its high price, and the lack of interest from investors, and it was said that the Soho Commercial Company is waiting to sell the commercial building as soon as it gets a good price to cover some of its loss, as they indicated that investing in this place will not return profit to its owner until after the passage of ten years at a minimum, which led to the diversion of investors from it. In addition, the office spaces were criticized as being non-modifiable and very dark. Also, the location of the building and its view of the Second Ring Road, one of the most polluted areas in Beijing, led to an increase in that requirement for high lighting, in addition to the large percentage of glass on its facade with its continuous emptiness of users, which increases the amount of radiation emitted from it to its surroundings (ar).

Also, her design for a commercial center in Beijing known as Galaxy Soho was severely criticized by Chinese cultural heritage activists. They believed that this design caused a lot of damage and destruction in the historic neighborhoods of Beijing and completely disrupted the historic layout of these areas (fa).

### Last Completed Major Projects (2013–2016)

#### Heydar Aliyev Center, Baku, Azerbaijan (2007–2013)

The [Heydar Aliyev Center](/article/en/Heydar_Aliyev_Center) in Baku, Azerbaijan (2007–2013) is a gigantic cultural and conference center containing three auditoriums, a library and museum, with a total space of 10,801 square meters on a surface of 15,514 square meters, and a height of 74 meters. Hadid wrote that "its fluid form emerges from the folds of the natural topography of the landscape and envelops the different functions of the center," though the building when completed was largely surrounded by Soviet-era apartment blocks. Peter Cook in Architectural Review called it "a white vision, outrageously total, arrogantly complete ... a unique object that confounds and contradicts the reasonable ... a wave form sweeping up, almost lunging, into the sky ... here is architecture as the ultimate statement of theatre ... It is the most complete realization yet of the Iraqi-born architect's vision of sweeping curves and flowing space."

Consisting of eight stories, the center includes an auditorium with 1000 seats, exhibition space, conference hall, workshop and a museum. No straight line was used in the project of the complex. The shape of the building is wave-like and the overall view is unique and harmonic. Such an architectural structure stands for post-modernist architecture and forms oceanic feeling. The lines of the building symbolize the merging of past and future.

While the building itself was widely praised, Dame Zaha was criticized in many circles when she was awarded Britain's most prestigious prize in architecture, the Design Museum "Design of the Year," the first woman to do so. The building was named for the former ruler of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, and commissioned by his son, Illham, who became president after his father's death in 2003. Hugh Williamson, director of Human Rights Watch for Europe and the Central Asian division, called Aliyev "an authoritarian leader and so is his son." The former Soviet secret police general ruled for 30 years, first as its Communist leader and then as its president. Amnesty International accused him of human rights abuses, balloting irregularities and intimidating the opposition while in power. Several architecture critics who admired the work itself felt that Dame Zaha should have raised questions about this repressive leader even as she accepted the commission, and other critics questioned the UK granting its most prestigious architecture award to a building which memorialized a vicious Soviet dictator.

The Heydar Aliyev Center is one of the world-renowned cultural centers, designed by architect Zaha Hadid, located in Baku, Azerbaijan. It was opened in 2013 after construction works lasted about seven years. The center has changed the patterns and concepts of urban designs in Azerbaijan. The style of the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center is completely different from the rest of the buildings surrounding it and existing in the city. Hadid highlighted through her design curves somewhat similar to high sea waves, which come in succession to give amazing fluidity starting from the square outside the building, and ending with the roof of the building that meets its floor at a specific point; it has no doors or walls, but is merely an extension of the environment around it, as a pile of sand on the beach swept by waves with all fluidity (ar).

It gives a civilized image of the country, especially as it bears the name of former Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev, as his son Ilham Aliyev, the current President of Azerbaijan, wanted to build a memorial to commemorate his father who preceded him in rule. The total area of the center is about 100,000 square meters, and it contains a huge car park consisting of four floors, in addition to overlooking distinctive natural areas, with an artificial waterfall on one of its outer walls to give a kind of tranquility to visitors. Inside, it contains a group of swimming pools, a conference center, and a large library, all intertwining within an open space interior with nothing obstructing its path (ar).

Zaha Hadid won the London Design Museum Award for 2014 for this center, and Hadid was the first woman to win the grand prize in this competition (ar).

#### Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul, South Korea (2007–2013)

The [Dongdaemun Design Plaza](/article/en/Dongdaemun_Design_Plaza) (2007–2013) is among the largest buildings in Seoul, South Korea. Its name means "Great Gate of the East," in reference to the old walls of the city. The complex of 86,574 square meters contains exhibition space, a museum of design, conference rooms and other common facilities, as well as the bureaux and a marketplace for designers which is open 24 hours a day. The main building is 280 meters long with seven levels, including three levels underground. The smooth-skinned, giant mushroom-like structure floating atop sloping pylons is made of concrete, aluminum, steel and stone on the exterior, and finished inside with plaster reinforced with synthetic fiber, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone on the interior. Hadid wrote that the principal characteristics of her design were "transparency, porousness, and durability." It also features many ecological features, including a double skin, solar panels, and a system for recycling water.

The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a cultural center in Seoul, South Korea, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. It is considered the largest three-dimensional building in the world (ar).

#### Library and Learning Center, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria (2008–2013)

The [Library and Learning Center](/article/en/Library_and_Learning_Center_of_the_Vienna_University_of_Economics_and_Business) was designed as the centerpiece of the new University of Economics in Vienna. Containing 28,000 square meters of space, its distinctive Hadid features include walls sloping at 35 degrees and massive black volume cantilevered at an angle over the plaza in front of the building. She described the interior as follows: "The straight lines of the building's exterior separate as they move inward, becoming curvilinear and fluid to generate a free-formed interior canyon that serves as the principal public plaza of the Center, as well as generating corridors and bridges ensuring smooth transitions between different levels."

Zaha Hadid won the design of a library and educational center on the campus of the University of Commerce and Economics in Vienna, Austria, as a polygonal block, the shape of its interior was inspired by its exterior lines defining the different floors. The exterior lines of the building separate as they enter the building to become curved and flowing, generating a free-form interior space, serving as the main public square for the center, as well as generating corridors and bridges ensuring smooth transition between different levels. The design is located on an area of 28,000 square meters in the middle of the university. The layout consists of three main volumes around the central space and corridors. The main block includes the service area, including the learning center and the economic library, while student services and library management are in the two smaller blocks. It contains within it a library, classrooms, administrative offices, a bookstore, a restaurant, a conference center, a cafeteria, a language laboratory, a meeting hall, and an event hall, and it was completed in 2012 (ar).

The smooth and curved interior lines contrast with the sharp and harsh exterior boundaries, and the external shape of the building was defined by two contrasting colored elements separated by glass; these different colors guide the internal movement and facilitate understanding the two main blocks from the outside directly. This design takes the form of a polygonal block to sit in the middle of the university campus in the college. The inclined edges sometimes and straight at other times dominate this cube, while its wide lines separate as soon as they reach inward, where these edges transform into something like a curve of sides, forming an internal public square in the center of the complex. Entry from the main entrance directly to the central amphitheater hall, which also serves as an auditorium filled with natural light, as well as the ramp system leading from the amphitheater to the entrance of the library and central services on the first floor, while the lockers and security areas are located in the mezzanine space below. Visitors can enter the library and students can enter the administrative offices via ramps and stairs ascending from the ground floor. The different areas on the upper levels are also connected via platforms, bridges, terraces, and halls (ar).

#### Serpentine Sackler North Gallery, Kensington Gardens, London, United Kingdom (2009–2013)

The [Serpentine Sackler Gallery](/article/en/Serpentine_Sackler_Gallery) is a synthesis of two distinct parts – the 19th century classical brick structure named The Magazine (a former gunpowder store), and a 21st-century tensile structure. This is the second art space (after the MAXXI Museum in Rome) where Zaha Hadid Architects worked on the melding of both old and new elements. Zaha Hadid's Magazine extension on the original Grade II building was aided by the reinstatement of the building to an historic arrangement as a free-standing pavilion within an enclosure, with the former courtyards covered. The North Gallery extension features Hadid's distinct hallmark of curves, and houses a series of skylights which welcome natural light into the space as well as retractable blinds when less light is needed. Hadid also worked in collaboration with architect and heritage specialist Liam O'Connor, whose reconstructions and conversions of the original space were designed in consultation with English Heritage and Westminster City Council. The extension houses internal exhibition spaces as well as the museum shop and offices for the curatorial team.

#### Innovation Tower, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China (2007–2014)

The [Innovation Tower](/article/en/Jockey_Club_Innovation_Tower) in Hong Kong (2007–2014) is part of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The building of 15 floors has 15,000 square meters of space, with laboratories, classrooms, studios and other facilities for 1,800 students and their faculty. It was built on the site of the university's former football pitch. The extremely complex forms of the building required computer modeling. Early designs experimented with a facade made of reinforced plastic, textiles or aluminum, but Hadid finally settled upon metal panels with multiple layers. The building seems to lean towards the city. The floors inside are visible from the exterior like geological strata.

The Innovation Tower Jockey Club is one of Hadid's architectural works in Hong Kong. Construction began in 2009 until its completion in late 2013. The building is located in the School of Design on the campus of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on a narrow and irregularly shaped site in the southeastern corner of the university campus. The tower is a series of layers of glass, contradicting the classical model of tower shapes. The design came in the form of two blocks attached like Siamese twins with smooth and curved interior spaces, where the ceiling edge merges with the floors and walls, and courtyards and halls are scattered in it. The building includes all the college's activities in its unified block, including design studios, laboratories, workshops, seminar and lecture spaces, in addition to classes and exhibitions on its entire area of fifteen floors and a length of 76 meters, accommodating 1800 students and staff (ar).

#### Wangjing SOHO Tower, Beijing, China (2009–2014)

Wangjing SOHO tower in Beijing is the second building Hadid designed for the major Chinese property developer, located half-way between the center of Beijing and the airport. The towers slope and curve; Hadid compared them to Chinese fans, "whose volumes turn one around the other in a complex ballet." The tallest building is 200 meters high, with two levels of shops and 37 levels of offices. A single atrium level three stories high joins the three buildings at the base.

#### Issam Fares Institute, AUB, Beirut, Lebanon (2014)

The [Issam Fares Institute](/article/en/Issam_Fares_Institute) is located in the campus of the American University of Beirut (AUB). It won the Agha Khan Award in 2016, the same year Hadid died. It has a 21 meters cantilever in order to preserve the existing landscape. The institute aims to harness, develop and initiate research of the Arab world to enhance and broaden debate on public policy and international relations. It is currently headed by Joseph Bahout.

On May 29, 2014, the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut inaugurated its new permanent headquarters, in a building designed by Zaha Hadid. The new headquarters was built with a grant from former Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister Issam Fares. The inauguration ceremony was held on the oval field in the upper section of the university campus, and was attended by more than 450 local, regional, and international figures. The building is located on an area of 3000 square meters representing the aspirations of the American University of Beirut for the twenty-first century (ar).

Hadid, who designed the headquarters, attended the inauguration ceremony, where she explained in her speech the purpose of the new headquarters design, saying that it "weaves from the corridors, links, and sites overlooking the university campus a forum for the exchange of ideas and a center for interaction and dialogue in the heart of the university." She added: "The design of the institute makes it a crossroads and a three-dimensional meeting place and space for university students, professors, researchers, and visitors to meet, communicate, and interact with each other and with the wider community." She also said: "The institute looks to the future and challenges us all to enrich our perception of the Arab world by expanding research and enlarging discussion circles" (ar).

#### Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre, Nanjing, China (2012–2015)

The [Nanjing International Youth Cultural Centre](/article/en/Nanjing_International_Youth_Cultural_Centre) are two skyscrapers in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. Tower 1 is 314.5 meters (1,032 ft) tall and Tower 2 is 255 meters (837 ft). Construction began in 2012 and ended in 2015.

#### Port Authority, Antwerp, Belgium (2016)

Of all her works, Hadid designed only one government building, the [Port Authority Building](/article/en/Havenhuis), or Havenhuis, in Antwerp, Belgium, completed in 2016. Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness, but Port Authority, a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch, seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The faceted glass structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp's role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It was one of the last works of Hadid, who died in 2016, the year it opened. The square in front of the building was renamed to Zaha Hadidplein (Zaha Hadidsquare) to honor her death.

### Death

On 31 March 2016, Hadid died of a heart attack at the age of 65 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, where she was being treated for bronchitis.

The statement issued by her London-based design studio announcing her death read, "Zaha Hadid was widely regarded to be the greatest female architect in the world today." She is buried between her father Mohammed Hadid and brother Foulath Hadid in Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey, England.

In her will she left £67m, bequeathing various amounts to her business partner and family members. Her international design businesses, which accounted for the bulk of her wealth, were left in trust.

### Posthumous Projects (2016–present)

#### Skyscraper proposed for Manhattan, New York, United States (Never built)

Skyscraper proposed for Midtown Manhattan to replace 666 Fifth Avenue. On 25 March 2017, Kam Dhillon reported a yet-to-be completed skyscraper design designed by Hadid prior to her death in 2016 in an article titled "Zaha Hadid Architects Unveils Monumental Skyscraper Project for NYC."

#### Salerno Harbor Station, Salerno, Italy (2000–2016)

The first major project to be completed shortly after her death was the [Salerno harbor station](/article/en/Stazione_Marittima_di_Salerno) in Salerno, Italy, her first major transportation building. She won the competition for the building in 2000, but then the project was delayed due to funding and technical issues. Hadid scouted the site from a police boat in the harbor to visualize how it would appear from the water. The final building covers 50,000 square feet and cost 15 million Euros. Paola Cattarin, the project architect who completed the building after Hadid's death, said, "We thought of the building as an oyster, with a hard shell top and bottom, and a softer, liquid, more organic interior." At the opening of the new building, posters of Hadid were placed around the city, saying, "Goodbye Zaha Hadid; Genius and Modernity, Inspiration and Transformation, Light That Takes Shape."

Zaha Hadid won the design of the maritime terminal in Salerno, southern Italy, in 2000. It serves as a visual, formative, and transitional composition between land and sea, like a formative mark where the land dissolves into the water. The design of the maritime terminal came as a rare piece extracted from the sea. It reflects an interconnected relationship between the city and water, which in turn made it a wonderful masterpiece between land and water on the commercial port pier of the city, directly connected to the construction of Freedom Square and the waterfront. It resembles a shell in its shape, and shell structures with a smooth perimeter were used in its design, just like a ship with its curves and overlaps. Its roof has extended ribs for protection from the intense sunlight. The water topography forms different spaces and provides a clear vision from different angles. The ground was carved into smooth blocks and inclined corridors. All this space clearly guides passengers through the building, and the lighting idea works on another level as well. From the outside, it affects as if it were a light house on the port. The terminal consists of three overlapping elements. There are a number of headquarters for the management of the terminal at the top and around it, an equipment station, and a pleasure boat station (ar).

#### 520 West 28th Street, Manhattan, New York, United States (2014–2017)

[520 West 28th Street](/article/en/520_West_28th_Street), also known as the Zaha Hadid Building, is located in New York City. Designed by the architect Zaha Hadid, the building was her only residential building in New York and one of her last projects before her death.

#### King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2009–2017)

Research and Office Complex was designed by Zaha Hadid. Hadid received the commission after a 2009 design competition. It opened in October 2017 and received a LEED Platinum certification. The complex consists of five interlocking buildings, a research center, a computer center, a conference center, a library and the Musalla, a place for prayer.

The headquarters of the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center is located in Riyadh next to Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University on the land of King Khalid International Airport north of Riyadh. It was officially opened by King Salman bin Abdulaziz on January 20, 2016 (ar).

#### Al-Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah, Qatar (2014–2019)

[Al-Janoub Stadium](/article/en/Al_Janoub_Stadium) is a retractable-roof football stadium in Al-Wakrah, Qatar that was inaugurated on 16 May 2019. This was the second of the eight stadiums inaugurated for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

Zaha Hadid Architects stated that "The stadium was designed in conjunction with a new precinct so that it sits at the heart of an urban extension of the city, creating community-based activities in and around the stadium on non-event days." According to the designers, it was inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the Persian Gulf.

Zaha Hadid presented a design, described by some as controversial, for Al Wakrah Stadium, the new headquarters of Al Wakrah Sports Club later, to be qualified to host the group stage, round of 16, and quarter-finals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Work on the stadium is expected to be completed during the last quarter of 2018, where it will reach a height of 48 meters. The stadium's facilities, on days when there are no league matches, will be transformed into a community center, providing covered and cooled areas for walking and sitting for residents of Al Wakrah and its visitors. The spaces designated for offices will provide headquarters for various sports institutions and committees. The field will be distinguished by its natural grass, and it will be cooled to an ideal temperature of 26 degrees Celsius. Similarly, the stadium design works to provide maximum comfort for the fans, as the stands will be cooled at temperatures ranging from 24 to 28 degrees Celsius. Following the end of the World Cup, the upper assembled part of Al Wakrah Stadium with its 20,000 seats will be dismantled to be donated to developing countries that lack sports infrastructure (ar).

Hadid faced several criticisms due to the appearance of the stadium, to the extent that it was compared to women's genitalia; a comparison that Hadid described as ridiculous, adding in an interview with Time magazine that those allegations are embarrassing and hollow. The London Guardian newspaper had called the stadium "the woman's vagina," referring to the formal similarity between the Qatari Al Wakrah Stadium and this sensitive part of the female body. Hadid was shocked by this strange comparison, which reduced the design, and wondered if everything with an opening is a woman's vagina (ar).

In November 2013, she designed Qatar's new stadium, "Al Janoub Stadium," for use in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The concept of this new stadium was inspired by Qatar's traditional fishing boat, the "dhow," and was designed not only for visual beauty but also to withstand the intense local sunlight. However, when the design was unveiled, it became a topic of conversation on the internet for "resembling female genitalia." In response, Zaha Hadid told TIME magazine, "I'm really baffled by their nonsensical opinions" and "What are they saying? That the hole in the building looks like female genitalia. It's ridiculous." She also stated, "If a man had designed it, such obscene comparisons would not have been made." But public opinion remained unchanged, and on November 26, the news site "Daily Beast," which merged with Newsweek, argued that "in the essence of artwork, the viewer's response is as important as the artist's intended message." It concluded that "the impression that it resembles female genitalia is not something anyone should condemn" (ja).

#### Scorpion Tower of Miami, Florida, United States (2015–2019)

The Scorpion Tower of Miami, now known as [One Thousand Museum](/article/en/One_Thousand_Museum), was started while Hadid was still alive. It is noted by its curved external columns standing the full length of the building. Its twin Scorpion Tower has also been built in Dubai.

#### Beijing Daxing International Airport, China (2014–2019)

The [Beijing Daxing International Airport](/article/en/Beijing_Daxing_International_Airport) opened in September 2019 in the form of a golden star (ru).

#### The Opus, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (2012–2019)

The [Opus](/article/en/The_Opus) designed by Zaha Hadid is a mixed-use 20 story tower, housing residences, offices, a mix of restaurants, retail spaces and a five-star hotel. The building comprises two structures that form a single cube which appears to hover above the ground, eroded by a fluid void.

The Floating Building in Dubai, or The Opus Tower, is a distinctive architectural icon in the Middle East and the world. It was designed in the latest global styles to be the City Scape of the Middle East. This tower consists of a cube with a large void in the center, and it is divided into two connected structures, 21 stories high, with a hidden base that makes it appear as if it is floating above the ground. It looks different at night than during the day, appearing during the day as a complete shiny cube with the reflection of the sun's rays on it, and at night with lights filling the spaces, as its glass facade absorbs light and glows with wonderful artificial lighting. This tower also contains other projects inside it, such as some hotels also prepared in the modern style, in addition to a group of international restaurants as well as famous brands on an area of 250,000 square feet. This project is expected to be completed by 2016 (ar).

#### Grand Theatre of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco (2014–2021)

A futuristic building, faithful to the imprint of the architect, which can host the biggest cultural events of the Moroccan capital. The works, launched in October 2014 and was completed in 2021. Grand Theatre of Rabat consists of a large multipurpose room, which has 1822 seats and can accommodate different types of shows. For each artistic presentation with specific acoustics needs, the theater is equipped with adjustable systems. The theater also has a small modular room with 127 seats, a restaurant with panoramic views, shops, cafes and a bookstore.

The Grand Theatre project in Rabat, Morocco, aims to make the city one of the major global cultural capitals, as it will rival the facilities of these capitals in terms of size, facilities, and architectural style. The design of the Grand Theatre included a large hall for performances that can accommodate 2,050 people, including advanced audiovisual services, in addition to a small theater that can accommodate 520 people, and the project will also include an outdoor amphitheater that can accommodate 7,000 people to receive various musical and artistic events in addition to other various facilities. The implementation of the project begins at a cost of approximately 100 million euros, about 1.35 billion Moroccan dirhams. An area of 47,000 square meters has been allocated in Rabat on the banks of the Bouregreg River to implement this project, with green areas planted with grass on an area of 27,000 square meters. The implementation of the project requires sixty-five months, based on the contract between the Bouregreg River Redevelopment Agency and Zaha Hadid's office, which received 10 million euros for the design and construction follow-up. This building will be financed through the state's general budget, the General Directorate of Local Communities, and the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development (ar).

#### Mercury Tower, St. Julian's, Malta (2016–2023)

The [Mercury Tower](/article/en/Mercury_Tower) is the tallest building in Malta. The Tower is 122 meters (400 ft) tall, with 32 floors of mixed residential and hotel space. The most iconic feature of the building is the twisted area between levels 9 and 11 that provide its distinctive appearance. This development is one of the last concept designs signed off by Zaha Hadid personally before her death in 2016.

#### Masaryčka, Prague, Czech Republic (2015–2023)

The "Masaryčka Connects" project is a significant urban regeneration effort in the center of Prague, transforming the city's first railway station, operational since 1845, into a modern transport hub. In 2015–2016, Zaha Hadid supervised the conceptual design of a new mixed-use building that replaced a formal cargo terminal.

The construction took place in 2020–2023, as some delay was caused by negotiations with heritage protection authorities. Reflective of Hadid's iconic style, the building integrates fluid forms and dynamic structures, intended to harmonize with Prague's existing architectural heritage while adding a modern element to the cityscape.

The design of the buildings features vertical, fin-like elements and a curvilinear base, intended to animate the streetscape and encourage public engagement. This structure utilizes its lower two floors for retail purposes, providing a commercial zone at street level. The office levels that follow above are topped off with a rooftop garden. Upcoming developments include a direct airport line and an elevated platform above the railway tracks, interconnecting the surrounding parts of the city.

#### Sky Park Residence I, II, III, IV, Bratislava, Slovakia (2016–2024)

Four identical 31-storey residential towers measuring 105 meters (355 ft) tall, in the Sky Park complex neighboring Bratislava city center. Although the project was presented in 2010, the construction on the project began in December 2016. The construction of the Sky Park Residence I, II and III was completed in 2020 and the construction of the fourth residential tower started in 2021 and was completed in 2024. All four towers housing 1,048 apartments.

#### KAFD Station, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (2014–2024)

A 7-story, 20,434 sq. meter King Abdullah Financial District Metro Station in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia opened in December 2024.

The foundation stone was laid for the construction of the Riyadh Metro Station in the Financial Center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2013, on an area exceeding 20,000 square meters, to be a main exchange point on the Line 1 network, as well as Line 4 designated for passengers heading to the airport, and Line 6 of the new Riyadh Metro, and the local automated train for the center will be connected to the station via a high bridge. The entire project aims to make the station a focal point in the city of Riyadh to greatly reduce traffic congestion (ar).

Electronic image designs of the train station, expected to be completed within four years between 2013 and 2017, which contains six lines according to the order of the Saudi monarch, Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, showed it as a space station in the Arab desert or a world of wonders or a five-star hotel. The design consists of large undulations that express the daily flow of traffic in Riyadh, which is home to five million people. Hadid's touches made the station open to a proposed train network, expected to rival the era of space stations, with fully marble-covered floors, walls lined with gold-water coating, in addition to natural air conditioning in one of the hottest parts of the world. The design from the inside appears as if travelers are living in non-enclosed atmospheres, so that the architect made the facade allow the interior to be almost completely lit without allowing the burning Gulf sun to penetrate. It was also taken into account that the final design of the station would include a reference to the sand dunes characteristic of the nature in the region (ar).

#### Central Bank of Iraq Tower, Baghdad, Iraq (2018–incomplete)

In May 2010, the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) had commissioned Hadid to design the new headquarters. Although the project was presented in 2011, the construction on the project only began in late 2018 and it is scheduled to be completed in 2025. Central Bank of Iraq Tower will serve as the new headquarters for the Central Bank of Iraq. It also features VIP entrance, visitor entrance, main lobby, museums, personnel entrance, energy center, public area, personnel facility, cash management area, data center, security center and landscaping areas.

The Central Bank of Iraq contracted with Hadid at the end of January 2012 to design the new Central Bank of Iraq building in the presence of representatives of the Iraqi Embassy in London. The new building will be constructed on the banks of the Tigris after Zaha Hadid's office completed a study of the project's requirements, as it represents a symbol of the bank's role in economic development in Iraq and a reflection of the determination to rebuild the country. For her part, Hadid expressed her deep emotion when she was asked to prepare the new design for the Central Bank of Iraq. She added that she was born in Iraq and still feels close to her homeland, and that she is honored to work in Iraq on designing a building of such national importance at this level (ar).

#### Sky Park Tower, Bratislava, Slovakia (2024–incomplete)

The tower with different design then the other four identical Sky Park Residence buildings is under construction in Bratislava. The last and tallest Sky Park 33-storey residential tower with 393 apartments is set to reach a height of 119 meters (390 ft) tall in the Sky Park complex. It will be the third tallest building in Slovakia. Although the project was presented together with Sky Park Residence in 2010, the construction on the Sky Park Tower only began in 2024. With expected completion in 2027, it will be the last posthumous completed project with direct involvement of Zaha Hadid before her death.

## Teaching

In the 1990s, she held the Sullivan Chair professorship at the University of Illinois at Chicago's University of Illinois at Chicago College of Architecture and the Arts school of architecture. At various times, she served as guest professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg (HFBK Hamburg), the Knowlton School of Architecture at Ohio State University, the Masters Studio at Columbia University, and was the Eero Saarinen Visiting professor of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. In 1994, she was the Kenzo Tange Visiting professor of architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. From 2000, Hadid was an o. Univ.-Prof. (Full professor) at the Institute of Architecture at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, in the Zaha Hadid Masterclass.

## Interior Architecture and Product Design

Hadid also undertook some high-profile interior work, including the Mind Zone at the [Millennium Dome](/article/en/Millennium_Dome) in London as well as creating fluid furniture installations within the Georgian surroundings of Home House private members club in Marylebone, and the Z.CAR hydrogen-powered, three-wheeled automobile, among many other designs.

In 2006, Zaha Hadid founded Zaha Hadid Design (ZHD); her eponymous design studio.

In 2007, Hadid designed Dune Formations for David Gill Gallery and the Moon System Sofa for leading Italian furniture manufacturer B&B Italia.

In 2009 she worked with the clothing brand [Lacoste](/article/en/Lacoste) to create a new, high fashion, and advanced boot. In the same year, she also collaborated with the brassware manufacturer Triflow Concepts to produce two new designs in her signature parametric architectural style.

In 2013, Hadid designed Liquid Glacial for David Gill Gallery which comprises a series of tables resembling ice-formations made from clear and colored acrylic. Their design embeds surface complexity and refraction within a powerful fluid dynamic. The collection was further extended in 2015–2016. In 2016 the gallery launched Zaha's final collection of furniture entitled UltraStellar.

ZHD now operates under the lead of Co-directors Woody Yao and Maha Kutay who ensure consistency with the Founder's ethos by continuing to coherently translate and apply Hadid's methodological approach to any new design.

Hadid believed that designing buildings and furniture pieces stem from the same thing, with flexibility and extension. The beginning was in the Guggenheim Museum project in Taiwan, then turned into a monument called Elastika in Miami, reaching a table for Vitra, then the Simulas collection, which was designed for Establisht & Sons, which took only two months. Hadid presented new designs for interior furniture, which were displayed on April 14, 2013, at the Milan International Furniture Exhibition, Salone del Mobile in Milan, within the Italian design house specialized in natural stones, Citco. She presented three designs for marble tables in black and white and inlaid with veins of gold color. The same exhibition also honored her in 2016 in its fifty-fifth session and displayed her latest works, where the Salone del Mobile exhibition was adorned with Zaha Hadid's unique pieces in their forms, which gave an impression of Zaha's distinctive personality. Each piece as a whole had a story reflecting her journey that proved even after her departure that she had become a global biography celebrated by design giants in the world. There were marble designs, expressing exceptional skills in which a contemporary style infused with luxury was used. She also displayed the collection of chairs she designed for the Ary grandstand in Milan as part of her exhibition of works she called Multiplesties in Milan. In London 2013, Hadid opened her exhibition of designs and furniture at the Clerkenwell Exhibition in central London (ar).

Hadid was interested in fashion and saw that it gave her an opportunity to express a set of ideas in a different size and with various tools, considering it part of the ongoing research in the world of design as a whole. Zaha Hadid applied new architectural methods to fashion, where she applied and learned from it as well, so that many common denominators appeared between architecture, fashion, and art in recent times (ar).

Hadid's creations extended to the world of fashion where prestigious global names collaborated with her, leaving a distinctive legacy. In 2006, she collaborated with Louis Vuitton to produce a bag bearing the same brand, where Hadid created a bucket-shaped bag made of molded white plastic, and covered its interior with crimson leather. 2008 was considered a joyful, rich year for Hadid, where she collaborated with Lacoste and launched a shoe with a long tongue of soft leather that wraps around the leg. In the same year, she designed Neil Barrett's fashion boutique in Tokyo. Then with the Brazilian brand Melissa, she designed a plastic shoe that mimics architectural structures. Then she worked with United Nude shoes, and their first collaboration resulted in the launch of Nova shoes in 2013, a vinyl shoe plated with chrome rubber with leather on the outside, with a light platform and a fiberglass heel. The roles continued to launch with Danish jewelry John Jensen designs that focus on sculpture, and repetition of body curves, in addition to including architectural masterpieces. She collaborated with Stuart Weitzman boutiques and Hadid designed more than one store for Stuart Weitzman, the first of which was the Milan boutique that opened in September 2014 where she made the walls of fiberglass. The Fendi House brand also had a role where Hadid redefined the Peekaboo bag in 2014 for the charity project that the brand launched at the time, and the bag was sold at a Sotheby's auction, and the money went to children's charities. The architect drew inspiration for crystal bracelets in warm bright colors for Swarovski. Adidas shoes also had a role in these creations, where Hadid worked on designing Adidas Originals Superstar sports shoes with Pharrell Williams. She also collaborated with the Lebanese jewelry house Aziz and Walid Mouzannar, and the jewelry was launched in 2016 (ar).

In 2015, she designed "B.zero1 Design Legend" rings in white, yellow, and rose gold for Bulgari (ru).

### Neil Barrett Aoyama Store

In September 2008, she collaborated with Patrik Schumacher of Zaha Hadid Architects to design the interior of the reopened Aoyama store of Italian fashion brand Neil Barrett. This was her first foray into shop design. Neil Barrett, who commissioned the store design, said in an interview: "I loved everything about her style, including its floating presence" and "We had many discussions during this project, but she never imposed her ideas on me. I was satisfied when I saw the first sketches and thought, 'This is it!'" It was the only architectural work by Zaha Hadid that could be seen in Japan, but it closed on August 18, 2013 (ja).

### Architectural Firm

Her architectural design firm, [Zaha Hadid Architects](/article/en/Zaha_Hadid_Architects), employs 400 people. Its headquarters from 1985 were in a Victorian former-school building in Clerkenwell, London. In 2021 they moved to Goswell Road, Clerkenwell.

Hadid established an architectural firm named Zaha Hadid Architects in New York. One of the notable buildings designed by this agency is the boutique pavilion of Il Makiage.

The firm was established in a former elementary school in London. Until ten years ago, only one classroom was her office, with the other classrooms rented out, but now the entire school is used, with a gallery-cum-office nearby. With branch offices in Hamburg and China, a total of 430 people worked there, including 250 in London (ja).

Since 2011, Zaha Hadid Architects maintained an office near the Speicherstadt in Hamburg for a few years in addition to its headquarters in Clerkenwell, London. The London architectural office is located in a former Victorian school and employed about 250 people in 2012. In 2015, there were around 400 architects working on over 950 projects in 44 countries (de).

## Reputation

Following her death in March 2016, Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times wrote: "her soaring structures left a mark on skylines and imaginations and in the process re-shaped architecture for the modern age...Her buildings elevated uncertainty to an art, conveyed in the odd way of one entered and moved through these buildings and in the questions that her structures raised about how they were supported ... Hadid embodied, in its profligacy and promise, the era of so-called starchitects who roamed the planet in pursuit of their own creative genius, offering miracles, occasionally delivering." She is quoted as saying "I don't make nice little buildings."

Deyan Sudjic of The Guardian described Hadid as "an architect who first imagined, then proved, that space could work in radical new ways ... Throughout her career, she was a dedicated teacher, enthused by the energy of the young. She was not keen to be characterized as a woman architect, or an Arab architect. She was simply an architect."

In an interview published in Icon magazine, she said: "I never use the issue about being a woman architect ... but if it helps younger people to know they can break through the glass ceiling, I don't mind that." However, she admitted that she never really felt a part of the male-dominant architecture "establishment." She once said "As a woman in architecture you're always an outsider. It's OK, I like being on the edge."

Sometimes called the "Queen of the curve," Hadid was frequently described in the press as the world's top female architect, although her work also attracted criticism. The Metropolitan Museum in New York cited her "unconventional buildings that seem to defy the logic of construction." Her architectural language was described as "famously extravagant" and she was accused of building "dictator states." Architect Sean Griffiths characterized Hadid's work as "an empty vessel that sucks in whatever ideology might be in proximity to it."

In 2013, Hadid founded a charitable organization, the [Zaha Hadid Foundation](/article/en/Zaha_Hadid_Foundation). It became operational in 2022 to look after Hadid's legacy and a collection of over 15,000 works by or related to Hadid, and is the only architectural foundation dedicated to a solo woman of color. The foundation operates from buildings formerly occupied by the Design Museum at Shad Thames and Zaha Hadid Architects at Bowling Green Lane, London.

## Qatar Controversy

As the architect of a stadium to be used for the [2022 FIFA World Cup](/article/en/2022_FIFA_World_Cup) in Qatar, Hadid was accused in The New York Review of Books of giving an interview in which she allegedly showed no concern for the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar involved in the project. In August 2014, Hadid sued The New York Review of Books for defamation and won. Immediately thereafter, the reviewer and author of the piece in which she was accused of showing no concern issued a retraction in which he said "work did not begin on the site for the Al Wakrah stadium, until two months after Ms Hadid made those comments; and construction is not scheduled to begin until 2015 ... There have been no worker deaths on the Al Wakrah project and Ms Hadid's comments about Qatar that I quoted in the review had nothing to do with the Al Wakrah site or any of her projects. I regret the error."

## Style

The architectural style of Hadid is not easily categorized, and she did not describe herself as a follower of any one style or school. Nonetheless, before she had built a single major building, she was categorized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a major figure in architectural [Deconstructivism](/article/en/Deconstructivism). Her work was also described as an example of [neo-futurism](/article/en/Neo-futurism) and [parametricism](/article/en/Parametricism). An article profiling Hadid in the New Yorker magazine was titled "The Abstractionist."

At the time when technology was integrating into design, Zaha accepted the use of technology but still continued to hand draw her buildings and make models of the designs. This was because she did not want to limit herself and her designs to only to what the computer could do.

Through her design style, she paints the conceptual designs of her many projects in fluid and geometrical forms where "Zaha Hadid's work took shape." These would be large paintings that would aspire towards her design process and "rational nature of her construction, the drawings pulled the parts and pieces apart, exploding its site and programme."

When she was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2004, the jury chairman, Lord Rothschild, commented: "At the same time as her theoretical and academic work, as a practicing architect, Zaha Hadid has been unswerving in her commitment to modernism. Always inventive, she's moved away from existing typology, from high tech, and has shifted the geometry of buildings."

The Design Museum described her work in 2016 as having "the highly expressive, sweeping fluid forms of multiple perspective points and fragmented geometry that evoke the chaos and flux of modern life."

Hadid herself, who often used dense architectural jargon, could also describe the essence of her style very simply: "The idea is not to have any 90-degree angles. In the beginning, there was the diagonal. The diagonal comes from the idea of the explosion which 're-forms' the space. This was an important discovery."

According to Hadid herself, the surge of interest in her work began after the [Guggenheim Museum Bilbao](/article/en/Guggenheim_Museum_Bilbao) was built in 1997 based on Frank Gehry's design. After participating in the construction of the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, USA, which opened in 2003, her ideas became truly in demand (ru).

As an architect, Hadid always tried to break conventional canons and "stretch" the framework of familiar space, giving it a powerful dynamic impulse. For the same purpose — to enhance internal movement and deformation — Zaha Hadid used distorted perspective, revealing sharp angles and curved lines. In her interviews, she repeatedly said that her creative method was formed under the influence of Russian constructivism (ru).

Zaha Hadid was committed to the deconstructivist school, which focuses on modern style and design, and implemented 950 projects in 44 countries. Her work was characterized by imagination, as she created designs with free-flowing lines unrestrained by horizontal or vertical boundaries. Her work was also characterized by durability, as she used steel in her designs. The Vitra Fire Station in Germany (1993), the MAXXI Museum of Italian Art in Rome (2009), the American Museum in Cincinnati, the Sheikh Zayed Bridge in Abu Dhabi, the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympic Games, the Strasbourg Metro Station, the Cultural Center in Azerbaijan, the Science Center in Wolfsburg, the Maritime Terminal in Salerno, the Ski Jump in Innsbruck, and the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center in Baku (2013) are among the most prominent projects that deservedly brought Hadid to the global stage (ar).

According to Hadid herself, the surge of interest in her work began after the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao was built in 1997 based on Frank Gehry's design. After participating in the construction of the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, USA, which opened in 2003, her ideas became truly in demand (ru).

Strongly influenced by Russian Constructivist architecture and art, she creates conceptual and imaginative works in real space, surprising visitors and users. Previously, like fellow deconstructivist Daniel Libeskind, she was mainly known as an advocate of architectural thought and a creator of drawings showing radical concepts rather than actual architectural works (ja).

Her work is characterized by drawings of countless road-like or pipe-like lines that gently bend, intersect, and overlap while flowing at high speed, and futuristic, massive organic structures (ja).

According to Mitsuhiro Kaneda (a structural engineer at Arup Tokyo office in 2012), "In addition to her commitment to form, the fusion of architecture and facade is very important" (ja).

Hadid's interest in architecture began when she went with her family on a trip to visit the ruins of the Sumerian civilization in southern Iraq, which is considered the oldest civilization known to mankind. Zaha says in an interview with The Guardian: "My father took us to visit the Sumerian cities, and we went by boat and then continued in a smaller boat made of reed bundles. The beauty of the landscapes there, with sand, water, birds, buildings, and people, has remained in my memory since that moment. I am trying to discover, or invent, an architectural style and forms of urban planning that have the same effect, but in a more modern way" (ar).

Zaha was greatly influenced by the work of Brazilian architect [Oscar Niemeyer](/article/en/Oscar_Niemeyer), especially his sense of space, as well as his exceptional talent. His works had inspired and encouraged her to create her own style, emulating his search for fluidity in all forms. Zaha Hadid's works were characterized by a clear architectural direction in all her works, known as deconstructivism or destructionism, an approach that involves high complexity and irregular geometry. She also used steel in her designs to withstand high degrees of tension and pressure loads, which enabled her to execute free and bold formations. She was also distinguished by her architectural works with potential energy, in addition to the authenticity and originality of her works, with high dynamism. Zaha Hadid played an active role in changing the concept of architecture in the world. Hadid contributed to creating a better world through her elegant designs for buildings, and her designs were considered unique, as if they belonged to the world of imagination on another planet (ar).

This trend appeared in 1971 and is considered one of the most important architectural movements that emerged in the twentieth century. This trend generally calls for the demolition of all the foundations of Euclidean geometry, attributed to the Greek mathematician Euclid, by deconstructing structures into parts. Despite the differences and contradictions between the pioneers of this trend, they agree on one fundamental thing: differing from everything that is familiar and traditional (ar).

Zaha believed that her designs interact with the city and give people a place to communicate, saying that followers of her work know that creating public spaces that people can use freely allows the city to flow in a smooth and easy way. What distinguished these designs is that they took a clear architectural direction based on an artistic and philosophical background, so they tended toward the imaginative and abstract. According to Jencks' classification of deconstructive architecture, Zaha Hadid's works fall within the modern constructivist trend, which was also associated with the works of Rem Koolhaas. Their vision is summarized in that it is based on strange and inclined supports, enjoys fluidity and deconstruction in defying gravity through insistence on flying ceilings and beams, with an emphasis on the dynamics of formation, to the extent that Zaha Hadid's works were called dynamic abstraction (ar).

## Imagination and Controversy

Imagination and idealism characterize Zaha Hadid's designs, which some claim are impossible to implement, as her buildings are based on strange and inclined supports, and some critics assert that these designs are overwhelmed by a state of strictness (ar).

Meanwhile, the Iraqi architect practically refuted accusations by some critics that she was a "paper engineer," meaning that her designs were difficult to implement, after the completion of the Science Museum in Wolfsburg, northern Germany, which opened in November 2005, confirming that the claim of "paper engineer" was nothing but a false allegation from architects living with the past; because everything she put on her computer screen, others were able to implement, as reported by Al-Sharqiya website (ar).

One critic said about her: "All her designs are in fluid motion, not defined by vertical or horizontal lines; it is not the architecture of women; she is a sensitive artist, presenting what she feels from the impact of technical and artistic development in all its directions in a world that has become a small village" (ar).

Architectural critic Andreas Ruby said about her creations and designs: "Zaha Hadid's projects resemble spaceships, floating without the influence of gravity in a vast space, with no high or low part, no face or back, they are buildings that appear as if in fluid motion in the surrounding space, and from the initial idea stage of Zaha's projects to the implementation stage; the spacecraft approaches the Earth's surface, and in its stability is considered the largest maneuvering operation in the field of architecture." Her partner Patrick Schumacher described her as: "A scream in what she presented, for two decades, in both drawing and architecture" (ar).

With Hadid's growing success, the number of her critics and the sharpness of the attacks on her also increased, increasingly organized in campaigns after construction awards or inaugurations. Finally, some critics attempted to associate her work with totalitarianism. For example, architect Michael Murphy described her work in an ambiguous way as "famously extravagant," as she created some of her projects for clients from "dictator states" such as China and Azerbaijan. Architect Sean Griffiths, one of her most determined opponents ("more outspoken than most"), attacked Hadid's work as an empty vessel and thus ideal for ideologies of any color (de).

Wolf D. Prix of [Coop Himmelb(l)au](/article/en/Coop_Himmelblau), who like many other architects builds in China and Azerbaijan, defended Hadid in 2014: "The discussions about Zaha Hadid's architectures are becoming increasingly ridiculous. She is famous, has many commissions, and this arouses envy. I don't know any architect who, faced with the question of building a cultural center according to his ideas in Baku or not, would have determinedly rejected this commission for moral reasons. But I know many architects who were never asked and are therefore all the more indignant in condemning those who accept commissions from so-called dictatorships. But the question is not whether one can build in authoritarian societies, but how one builds." On the one hand, architects today are burdened with ever greater, even "seemingly moral" obligations, while at the same time their influence on the building process is becoming increasingly smaller (de).

A second level of criticism focuses on the aesthetics of Zaha Hadid's work. For example, art historian Maike Aden interprets the MAXXI Museum in Rome as a "seclusion" from the public and urban life, which she illustrates with several fence photos. The MAXXI thus carries "the unmistakable message of a de-democratization of art." This "seclusion" she perceives is so great that the museum can no longer be compensated for with "low-threshold" or "more diversified" museum education and "more public relations work." In fact, the outer fence only serves to protect art objects that are exhibited around the museum and are located away from the large piazza in front of the entrance. In her thesis on the MAXXI, art historian Herta Gurtner comes to the opposite conclusion, namely that it "succeeded [...] in designing the area open and inviting for everyone, not just for museum visitors" (de).

In a general way, art historian Laura Weißmüller judged in the Süddeutsche Zeitung that Zaha Hadid did not want to be restricted and developed an aesthetic form language that was so clear "that it eventually covered the function - and the place where the building stood." This blanket judgment also contradicts Hadid's understanding of her buildings, which she primarily saw as "bridges" intended to connect people (de).

## Awards and Honours

Hadid was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to architecture.

Hadid was named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. She was on the board of trustees of The Architecture Foundation.

In 2002, Hadid won the international design competition to design Singapore's one-north master plan. In 2004, Hadid became the first female recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 2005, her design won the competition for the new city casino of Basel, Switzerland and she was elected as a Royal Academician. In 2006, she was honored with a retrospective spanning her entire work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; that year she also received an Honorary Degree from the American University of Beirut.

In 2008, she was ranked 69th on the Forbes list of "The World's 100 Most Powerful Women." In 2010, she was named by Time as an influential thinker in the 2010 TIME 100 issue. In September 2010 the New Statesman listed Zaha Hadid at number 42 in its annual survey of "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures of 2010."

In 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, Hadid appeared on Debrett's list of the most influential people in the UK. In January 2015, she was nominated for the Services to Science and Engineering award at the British Muslim Awards.

She won the Stirling Prize, the UK's most prestigious award for architecture, two years running: in 2010, for one of her most celebrated works, the MAXXI in Rome, and in 2011 for the Evelyn Grace Academy, a Z‑shaped school in Brixton, London. She also designed the Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park in Seoul, South Korea, which was the centerpiece of the festivities for the city's designation as World Design Capital 2010. In 2014, the Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre, designed by her, won the Design Museum Design of the Year Award, making her the first woman to win the top prize in that competition. In 2015, she became the first woman to receive the Royal Gold Medal awarded by the Royal Institute of British Architects.

In 2016 in Antwerp, Belgium a square was named after her, Zaha Hadidplein, in front of the extension of the Antwerp Harbour House designed by Zaha Hadid.

Google celebrated her achievements with a Doodle on 31 May 2017, to commemorate the date (in 2004) on which Hadid became the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize.

Zaha Hadid received numerous prestigious awards, medals, and honorary titles in the field of architecture. She was one of the first women to receive the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 2004, which is equivalent in value to the Nobel Prize in Engineering. She won the Stirling Prize on two occasions and was awarded the Order of the British Empire and the Japanese Imperial Order in 2012. She also received the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 2016, becoming the first woman to receive this honor. She was described as the most powerful engineer in the world and believed that the field of architectural engineering was not exclusive to men. She achieved Arab and global accomplishments and did not limit herself to architectural designs but also designed furniture and even shoes. Prestigious global names were eager to collaborate with Hadid, which led her critics to call her the Lady Gaga of the engineering world. She was ranked as the fourth most powerful woman in the world in 2010 (ar).

Zaha Hadid represented a success story starring a well-known architectural woman, who traveled the world achieving numerous accomplishments, starting from Baghdad. Hadid harvested many awards, medals, honorary titles, and certificates of appreciation from architecture legends such as Japanese Kenzo Tange, and her name jumped to the ranks of the world's architectural giants. The Iraqi engineer won the highest Austrian award in 2002; she received the Austrian State Tourism Award. She was chosen as the fourth most powerful woman in the world in 2010 according to Time magazine's classification. UNESCO had included Hadid in the list of Artists for Peace who use their influence and global reputation to promote the organization's ideals, where it praised in a statement her efforts in the field of architectural art and her role in raising public awareness of intellectual dialogue and excellence in the field of design and creativity and her dedication to serving the ideals and goals of the organization. The selection process came after she topped the thinkers category in Time magazine's list of the hundred most influential personalities in the world. Hadid ranked sixty-eighth among the world's most powerful women according to the annual ranking announced by Forbes business magazine, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel occupied the first place for the second year in a row on the list of the hundred most powerful women in the world (ar).

In 2004, Zaha Hadid won the Pritzker Prize awarded by the Hyatt Foundation, owner of the Regency hotels chain, to a living architect, which is equivalent in value to the Nobel Prize, with a material value of $100,000 accompanied by a bronze medal. She was the youngest person to win it at the time, where the jury praised the urban achievements Hadid had accomplished and described them as "important and lasting contributions to humanity." The prize was awarded to her after she won the competition to build the Rosenthal Center for Modern Art in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2004. In 2006, the American University in Beirut awarded her an honorary doctorate in recognition of her efforts, in addition to receiving the Order of the Empire with the rank of Commander from France (ar).

In 2007, she was awarded the Thomas Jefferson Award for Architecture, in recognition of her serious and unique contribution to architecture. It is an award given to architects since 1966 on an annual basis. In 2012, she received the Japanese Imperial Order and the Order of Merit from Queen Elizabeth, and was chosen as the best personality in Britain. Zaha Hadid became an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Institute of Architects (ar).

In 2014, she won the London Design Museum Award for her design of the Heydar Aliyev Center in Azerbaijan. In 2016, she won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal for Architecture. The Iraqi architect Zaha became the first woman to receive this award, which is the highest honor presented by the Royal British Institute in recognition of historical achievement in the field of architecture. Zaha Hadid has a fortune estimated at $215 million (ar).
