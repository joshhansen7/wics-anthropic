# Timothy Donald Cook

Timothy Donald "Tim" Cook (born November 1, 1960) is an American business executive who serves as the chief executive officer (CEO) of [Apple Inc.](/article/en/Apple_Inc.) Cook previously served as the company's [chief operating officer](/article/en/Chief_operating_officer) (COO) under [Apple](/article/en/Apple_Inc.) co-founder [Steve Jobs](/article/en/Steve_Jobs). Under Cook's leadership, Apple has become the world's largest technology company by revenue, reaching US$394.33 billion in 2023. His tenure has seen Apple's market value grow from $348 billion when he took over in 2011 to $3 trillion by early 2022.

Cook is also a board member of [Nike, Inc.](/article/en/Nike,_Inc.) and the [National Football Foundation](/article/en/National_Football_Foundation), and serves as a trustee of [Duke University](/article/en/Duke_University), his alma mater. In 2014, Cook became the first openly gay CEO of a [Fortune 500](/article/en/Fortune_500) company. In the [Forbes](/article/en/Forbes) magazine's list of "The World's Most Powerful People," he was ranked 24th in 2018.

## Early Life and Education

Timothy Donald Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in [Mobile, Alabama](/article/en/Mobile,_Alabama), United States. He grew up in nearby [Robertsdale, Alabama](/article/en/Robertsdale,_Alabama), where he was baptized in a [Baptist](/article/en/Baptist) church. His father, Donald Cook, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine Cook, worked at a pharmacy. He has two brothers, Mike and Gerald.

Cook's father once noted, "Every Sunday, Timothy would definitely call home to talk to his mother, and he never forgot." During his youth, Cook worked as a newspaper delivery boy.

Cook was an exemplary student at Robertsdale High School. According to the school yearbook, he was a model student from grades 7 through 12, although his parents were reportedly unaware of how excellent his academic performance was. In 1978, he graduated as salutatorian (second in his class) and delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony. Fei Paris, who taught Cook's Advanced English course, described him as a "smart student." He represented Robertsdale in a summer student leadership program organized by the [American Legion](/article/en/American_Legion) for high school students and was also a member of the school band.

Cook earned a Bachelor of Science in [Industrial Engineering](/article/en/Industrial_Engineering) from [Auburn University](/article/en/Auburn_University) in 1982, and later received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from [Duke University](/article/en/Duke_University)'s [Fuqua School of Business](/article/en/Fuqua_School_of_Business) in 1988, where he was named a Fuqua Scholar. Despite his MBA, Cook has described himself not as a business manager but as an "engineering apprentice," emphasizing the analytical thinking his education provided.

His connection to Auburn University remains strong; his office and residence reportedly contain Auburn University memorabilia. Although he has personally donated to Auburn's College of Engineering for many years, his low-key personality made him reluctant to publicize this. Cook is also an avid fan of the Auburn Tigers football team, which won national championships in 1957 and 2010.

## Career

### Pre-Apple Era

After graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years (1983-1994) at [IBM](/article/en/IBM), where he eventually became Director of North American Fulfillment for IBM's personal computer business. In this role, he managed manufacturing and distribution of IBM products in North America and Latin America.

From 1994 to 1997, Cook served as Chief Operating Officer of the distributor division at computer wholesaler Intelligent Electronics until the company was acquired by [Microsoft](/article/en/Microsoft) in 1997.

In mid-1997, Cook joined [Compaq Computer Corporation](/article/en/Compaq) as Vice President of Corporate Materials. On January 7, 1998, while Cook was still considering whether to resign, Compaq was selected as one of the most notable companies of 1997 by Forbes magazine. However, he would remain at Compaq for only about six months before accepting an offer from Steve Jobs to join Apple.

### Apple Era

#### Early Years (1998-2011)

In 1998, Steve Jobs recruited Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook later described his decision:

"Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company."

Cook's first position at Apple was Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations. He quickly made his mark by radically overhauling Apple's manufacturing strategy, closing factories and warehouses around the world and replacing them with contract manufacturers. This approach reduced the company's inventory from a 70-day supply to less than 10 days' worth, streamlining the supply chain and significantly improving profit margins.

From 2000 to 2002, Cook's responsibilities expanded beyond operations to include sales and backend technical support services. In April 2001, he terminated Apple's partnership with distributor Computerware, and the following month, Apple began establishing exclusive retail stores to sell products directly to consumers.

From 2002 to 2005, Cook managed both operations and sales, and in 2004, he also took over the Macintosh hardware business, effectively overseeing both manufacturing and sales simultaneously.

Cook's group had the foresight to recognize the strategic importance of [flash memory](/article/en/Flash_memory) and made significant long-term investments, including prepayments for flash memory from 2005 onward. This strategy ensured a stable supply for products like the [iPod Nano](/article/en/iPod_Nano), [iPhone](/article/en/iPhone), and [iPad](/article/en/iPad).

Cook served as Apple's acting CEO for the first time from July to September 2004 while Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. During this period, Cook handled several significant events, including quarterly financial reporting and new product announcements. Under his temporary leadership, Apple's market value increased by 6.0%, outperforming the [NASDAQ](/article/en/NASDAQ) index, which fell by 10.2% during the same period.

On October 14, 2005, Cook was officially promoted to Chief Operating Officer. In announcing the promotion, Jobs told employees: "Cook's management performance over the past two years has led to his promotion today," and expressed his hope that "Cook will continue to work hard and get closer to Apple's promising future goals."

In November 2005, Cook joined Nike's board of directors as its 11th member. Nike cited Cook's "rich experience from global manufacturing to operational management practices" as valuable assets to their board.

Cook again served as acting CEO in 2009 when Jobs took medical leave for a liver transplant, and once more in January 2011 during Jobs' third medical leave. During these periods, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs continued to make major decisions.

#### Apple CEO (2011-Present)

On August 24, 2011, after Jobs resigned as CEO due to his declining health, Cook was officially appointed as Apple's new CEO. Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died from complications related to pancreatic cancer.

On October 4, 2011, Cook presided over his first product launch event as CEO, announcing the [iPhone 4S](/article/en/iPhone_4S). On October 29, 2012, Cook made significant changes to Apple's executive team. Scott Forstall, Senior Vice President of iOS, resigned following the poorly received launch of [Apple Maps](/article/en/Apple_Maps) and worked as Cook's advisor until leaving the company in 2013. John Browett, Senior Vice President of Retail, was dismissed after just six months.

Forstall's responsibilities were divided among four other Apple executives: Design SVP [Jony Ive](/article/en/Jonathan_Ive) took leadership of Apple's Human Interface team; [Craig Federighi](/article/en/Craig_Federighi) became the new head of iOS Software Engineering; services chief [Eddy Cue](/article/en/Eddy_Cue) became responsible for Maps and Siri; and [Bob Mansfield](/article/en/Bob_Mansfield), previously SVP of Hardware Engineering, became the head of a new Technology group.

These executive changes came after a fiscal quarter in which revenue and profits grew less than expected. Forstall's departure was widely viewed as a dismissal, reportedly stemming from Cook's desire to reduce "rivalries between executives" and foster a more collaborative culture within Apple.

Under Cook's leadership, Apple has continued to grow significantly. From 2011 to 2020, he doubled the company's revenue and profits, increasing Apple's market value from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion. By early 2022, Apple's market capitalization had reached $3 trillion, making it the first company to achieve this milestone.

In October 2019, Cook was appointed chairman of the advisory board for [Tsinghua University](/article/en/Tsinghua_University)'s School of Economics and Management in Beijing, China, for a three-year term.

In 2016, Cook reportedly signed a $275 billion deal with Chinese officials. This deal was said to have paved the way for increased censorship by Apple in China, including the removal of Muslim content, preventing users from entering numbers that refer to the date of the [Tiananmen Square massacre](/article/en/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989), censoring Chinese words like "human rights" or "democracy," and manipulating Apple Maps to support China in territorial disputes.

In August 2021, Cook received an approximate $750 million payout after selling more than five million shares in Apple, marking ten years as CEO.

In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Cook addressed company employees urging them to make donations to help Ukraine. He announced the decision to suspend the sale of Apple products in Russia and stated that the company would triple the amount of donations made by employees to support Ukraine, retroactively from February 25, 2022.

## Leadership Style

As Apple's CEO, Cook is known for his rigorous work ethic. He typically begins sending emails at 4:30 AM each weekday, exercises at the gym for an hour, and arrives at his office around 6:00 AM. In the past, he has held Sunday night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the upcoming week.

His leadership style contrasts with Jobs' micromanagement approach. Cook has implemented a more liberal and collaborative culture at Apple. In May 2013, he described his leadership philosophy as focusing on three key elements: people, strategy, and execution. He explained, "If you get those three right, the world is a great place."

Cook is particularly skilled at managing numbers through spreadsheets and reportedly doesn't miss even slight numerical discrepancies. His colleagues and business partners have described him as a "workaholic" who remains energetic even after long meetings. His dedication to work was illustrated in a story published by The New York Times: during an 18-hour flight to Singapore in 2010, while other Apple executives socialized briefly before resting, Cook studied materials and prepared for meetings with Apple employees in Asia. After arriving at 6 AM, he went straight to a 12-hour meeting, remaining energetic while others were exhausted.

Cook's speaking style differs markedly from Jobs'. He speaks with a steady tone and slight Southern American accent, earning him the nickname "Southern Gentleman." His presentations are often described as more moderate and calmer than Jobs' dynamic performances, though some find them "boring" or "dull." However, when discussing products he disapproves of, Cook can be quite direct and critical.

Under Cook's leadership, Apple has increased its charitable donations. In 2013, he hired [Lisa Jackson](/article/en/Lisa_P._Jackson), former Administrator of the [Environmental Protection Agency](/article/en/Environmental_Protection_Agency), to assist Apple with developing its renewable energy initiatives.

LG Display's President Kwon Young-soo, who meets with Cook several times a year, noted in 2011: "I found that Cook's greatest strength is that he listens carefully to what his subordinates say, and I think this is something I should learn from him."

## Personal Life

Cook is known as a fitness enthusiast who enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He has been described as a "gym rat" (a term for someone who spends significant time at the gym) and is reportedly a fan of cyclist [Lance Armstrong](/article/en/Lance_Armstrong). He has visited national parks including [Yosemite](/article/en/Yosemite_National_Park) in California and [Zion](/article/en/Zion_National_Park) in Utah.

In 1996, at age 36, Cook was misdiagnosed with [multiple sclerosis](/article/en/Multiple_sclerosis). Although it was later determined to be a misdiagnosis, the experience profoundly affected his outlook on life. In 1999, he published an article titled "You Can Look at the World from a Different Angle" in Auburn University's alumni publication. He has since participated in charity fundraising events, such as cycle races to raise money for multiple sclerosis research. He later told the Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms had been caused by "lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around."

Cook is known for being private about his personal life. In June 2014, he attended San Francisco's [gay pride parade](/article/en/San_Francisco_Pride) along with a delegation of Apple staff. On October 30, 2014, Cook publicly came out as gay in an editorial for [Bloomberg Businessweek](/article/en/Bloomberg_Businessweek), writing, "I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me." He explained that while he had been open about his sexuality "for years" and many at Apple were aware, he felt that his privacy was "valuing it too far above what I could do for other people."

Before officially coming out, Cook had appeared for three consecutive years (2012-2014) on Out magazine's "Power List" of influential LGBT people, ranking first in 2012 and 2013, and second in 2014.

In his coming-out article, Cook emphasized that being gay had given him "a deeper understanding of minority experiences" and made him "more empathetic." He stated that his decision to come out publicly was motivated by a desire to help others: "If knowing that the CEO of Apple is gay can provide encouragement or comfort to someone questioning who they are or feeling alone, I believe it's worth trading my personal privacy."

Cook consulted with [Anderson Cooper](/article/en/Anderson_Cooper), who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of his statement, and carefully timed the announcement to ensure it would not distract from business interests.

According to the book "Becoming Steve Jobs," Cook once offered to donate part of his liver to Jobs, who needed a liver transplant, but Jobs refused. Cook confirmed this account in a media interview.

## Political Views and Public Affiliations

Cook's political stance is not clearly defined. He has been reported to hold Republican registration in Northern California but has also supported Democratic candidates.

During the 2008 election cycle, Cook donated to [Barack Obama](/article/en/Barack_Obama)'s presidential campaign. In 2015, he donated to Democratic senators [Chuck Schumer](/article/en/Chuck_Schumer) and [Patrick Leahy](/article/en/Patrick_Leahy) for their positions on e-book pricing and surveillance reform, respectively. During the same election cycle, he hosted a fundraiser for Republican senator [Rob Portman](/article/en/Rob_Portman). In early March 2016, Cook disclosed that he donated to the election campaign of Democratic representative [Zoe Lofgren](/article/en/Zoe_Lofgren) of California. In June 2016, he hosted a private fundraiser with then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives [Paul Ryan](/article/en/Paul_Ryan), described by [Politico](/article/en/Politico) as "a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans."

In the 2016 election, Cook raised funds for the presidential campaign of [Hillary Clinton](/article/en/Hillary_Clinton). At one point, Clinton's campaign reportedly considered Cook as a potential vice-presidential candidate.

Cook has advocated for political reform in various areas, including international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, national manufacturing, and environmental preservation. He has publicly supported [LGBT rights](/article/en/LGBT_rights) and criticized state governments that do not recognize same-sex marriage.

In September 2017 at Bloomberg's Global Business Forum, Cook defended the [DACA](/article/en/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals) immigration program and expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of [Donald Trump](/article/en/Donald_Trump)'s administration, stating: "This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this."

In 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed concerns about the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public "very uncomfortable."

In March 2019, during a meeting for the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board with President Trump, Trump referred to Cook as "Tim Apple." Cook later leaned into the slip-up by changing his display name on [Twitter](/article/en/Twitter) to "Tim Apple."

On January 20, 2025, Cook reportedly attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol, along with other tech executives including [Elon Musk](/article/en/Elon_Musk), [Mark Zuckerberg](/article/en/Mark_Zuckerberg), and [Jeff Bezos](/article/en/Jeff_Bezos).

## Philanthropy

Cook has engaged in philanthropic activities throughout his career. In March 2015, he announced his intention to donate his fortune to charity after providing for his nephew's education.

Under his leadership, Apple has increased its charitable donations. In 2013, Apple recruited former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to support the development of renewable energy initiatives.
