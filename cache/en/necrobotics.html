# Necrobotics

**Necrobotics** (a portmanteau of "necro-" and "robotics") is the practice of utilizing biotic materials or dead organisms as robotic components. The field represents an alternative approach to mechanical engineering by repurposing biological structures designed through [evolution](/article/en/Evolution) and [natural selection](/article/en/Natural_selection), thereby exploiting highly developed organic systems that would be difficult or costly to manufacture artificially.

## History

The concept of necrobotics originated in 2019 when researchers at [Rice University](/article/en/Rice_University) in Houston, Texas discovered a dead spider in the laboratory of Daniel J. Preston. Upon observation, the research team—led by Te Faye Yap, a mechanical engineering graduate—noticed that the spider's legs were drawn toward its body and recognized that spider leg movement was based not on muscle contraction but on the pumping of [hemolymph](/article/en/Hemolymph) (spider blood) into the limbs through a hydraulic system.

The team conducted initial experiments in September 2019 to demonstrate the use of a dead spider as a gripping tool by exploiting this hydraulic principle. Research was suspended during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/article/en/COVID-19_pandemic), resuming in July 2021. In July 2022, the researchers published their foundational paper, "Necrobotics: Biotic Materials as Ready-to-Use Actuators," in the journal *Advanced Science*. The publication generated extensive media coverage, including appearances on the American late-night program *[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert](/article/en/The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert)*. In September 2023, the research group was awarded the [Ig Nobel Prize](/article/en/Ig_Nobel_Prize) in Engineering (also reported as the Ig Nobel Prize in Mechanical Engineering).

## Biological Basis

### Spider Anatomy and Hydraulic System

The primary appeal of spider bodies in necrobotics lies in their compact leg mechanism and hydraulic pressure system. Spider anatomy employs a simple hydraulic system based on fluid pressure. Spider legs contain flexor muscles that naturally constrict and keep the legs folded when relaxed. To extend and straighten their legs requires external force, which spiders accomplish by pumping hemolymph fluid through their joints as a means of hydraulic pressure. Critically, curling the legs requires no external power due to the flexor muscles' natural curled state—energy is only needed for extension.

This elegant biological design provides several advantages for robotic applications: the mechanism is inherently compact, requires minimal energy for one direction of movement, and has been perfected through millions of years of evolution.

## Applications and Development

### Spider Grippers

The first and most extensively developed necrorobotic application is the spider gripper. Researchers demonstrated that dead spiders could be converted into precise, delicate gripping mechanisms by converting their natural hydraulic system into a pneumatic (air-based) system.

The necrobotic spider gripper is capable of grasping small and lightweight objects, irregularly shaped objects, and heavier objects relative to the spider's size. It serves as an alternative to complex and costly small mechanical grippers. The gripper can be fabricated in less than 30 minutes and possesses a functional lifespan of 700 to 1,000 cycles, making it suitable for applications requiring delicate manipulation of materials and movement of light objects in confined spaces, such as microelectronics for simple pick-and-place tasks.

### Emerging Applications

Recent research has expanded necrobotics beyond spider grippers:

- **Bio-hybrid olfactory sensors**: In April 2025, researchers at [Shinshu University](/article/en/Shinshu_University) created a "bio-hybrid drone" utilizing silk-worm moth antennae to detect odor sources, demonstrating that necrobotics principles extend to sensory applications.

- **Bioprinting nozzles**: In November 2025, researchers at [McGill University](/article/en/McGill_University) demonstrated the use of a mosquito proboscis as a fine nozzle in experimental [3D printing](/article/en/3D_printing), showcasing applications in precision manufacturing.

Future applications could leverage [soft robotics](/article/en/Soft_robotics) and electrical stimulation to convert biological materials into bio-hybrid systems, and utilize existing skeletal structures to house robotic components.

## Fabrication Process

The creation of a necrobotic spider gripper follows these steps:

1. **Euthanization**: The spider is euthanized humanely using a cold temperature of approximately −4 °C (25 °F) maintained for 5–7 days.
2. **Needle insertion**: A 25-gauge hypodermic needle is inserted into the spider's cephalothorax (main body section).
3. **Sealing**: Adhesive (glue) is applied around the needle to form an airtight seal and allowed to dry completely.
4. **Pump attachment**: A syringe or pneumatic pump is connected to the needle.
5. **Actuation**: Air is pumped into the spider's body to extend the legs, or removed to contract them.

## Technical Performance

### Internal Pressure and Gripping Force

The typical pressure in a resting spider's legs ranges from 4 kilopascals (kPa) to 6.1 kPa. Researchers extended the legs by increasing internal pressure to 5.5 kPa through air injection. The relationship between internal pressure and gripping force is inverse: as internal pressure decreases, gripping force increases; conversely, as internal pressure increases, gripping force decreases.

When internal pressure is reduced to 0 kPa, the gripper closes completely, allowing it to grasp objects. By grasping individual weighted cellulose acetate (or acetate) beads, the necrobotic gripper achieves a maximum gripping force of 0.35 millinewtons (mN).

### Spider Size and Gripping Force

Researchers created predictive models correlating spider body size to gripping capacity. For wolf spiders, body weight is approximately equal to the gripping force of the legs. A typical wolf spider gripper has a mass of 33.5 milligrams and can lift 1.3 times its own body weight (43.6 mg or 0.35 mN).

However, this relationship is not linear. Larger spiders show an inverse relationship between mass and relative gripping force: a 200-gram [goliath birdeater](/article/en/Goliath_birdeater) is predicted to lift only 10% of its own weight (20 grams or 196 mN). Despite this inverse relationship with body weight, larger spiders exert greater absolute gripping forces than smaller spiders.

### Operational Lifespan and Degradation

The gripper's functionality is entirely dependent on the structural integrity of the spider's body. Cyclic testing (repeated opening and closing operations) demonstrates that the necrobotic gripper can actuate 700 to 1,000 times before significant degradation occurs. After approximately 1,000 cycles, cracks begin forming on the membrane of the leg joints due to dehydration. Weakened and decomposing joints lead to frequent breakage and necessary replacement, presenting an obstacle to real-world deployment.

### Preservation and Maintenance

One theoretical solution to extend gripper lifespan involves applying [beeswax](/article/en/Beeswax) or other lubricants to the joints. Research demonstrates that over 10 days, the mass loss of an uncoated spider is 17 times greater than that of a spider coated with beeswax. Lubricating joints combats dehydration and significantly slows the loss of organic material, potentially extending operational viability.

## Limitations and Constraints

### Biological Degradation

Organic materials inherently possess a higher likelihood of decomposition and structural failure compared to traditional mechanical systems. This necessitates additional maintenance work and potential replacement of grippers upon failure. Unlike manufactured components produced to consistent specifications, biological materials exhibit natural variability that can reduce system reliability.

### Biological Variability

Not all wolf spiders develop identically, resulting in organic inconsistencies that yield variable results between individual grippers. Gripping force and leg contraction can vary significantly between specimens, complicating standardization and quality control in practical applications.

### Ethical Considerations

Necrobotics raises significant [ethical](/article/en/Ethics) questions regarding the euthanization of organisms for technological purposes. Critics argue that:

- Necrobotics represents a fetishization of violence
- It subsumes life and death under capitalist production cycles, forming part of what some theorists term "necrocapitalism"
- The practice challenges ethical boundaries in the pursuit of bio-hybrid systems
- It may establish precedent for the bio-hybridization of mammals
- It constitutes intrusive interference with natural systems

Proponents counter that:

- Repurposing animal materials has been standard human practice for millennia
- Necrobotics should be pursued as a means of advancing scientific knowledge and technological capability
- The field represents efficient utilization of materials that would otherwise be discarded
