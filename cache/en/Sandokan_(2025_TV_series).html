# Sandokan (2025 TV series)

Sandokan, also known as "Sandokan: The Pirate Prince" or "Sandokan: Prince of Pirates," is a 2025 Italian-French television series directed by Jan Maria Michelini and Nicola Abbatangelo. The series is based on the adventure novels by [Emilio Salgari](/article/en/Emilio_Salgari) featuring the pirate hero Sandokan, as well as drawing inspiration from their popular 1976 [television adaptation](/article/en/Sandokan_(1976_TV_series)) which became a classic in Italy. The first season aired on [Rai 1](/article/en/Rai_1) between December 1 and 16, 2025, and is also available on streaming platforms including [Disney+](/article/en/Disney+) and [Voyo](/article/en/Voyo).

## Plot

Borneo, 1841. Amid the [British colonial rule](/article/en/British_colonization) of the region, Sandokan is a pirate who sails the [South China Sea](/article/en/South_China_Sea) together with his faithful friend Yanez de Gomera and the rest of his international crew. While boarding a cargo ship belonging to the [Sultan of Brunei](/article/en/Sultanate_of_Brunei), Sandokan frees a mysterious prisoner, who believes him to be the prophesied warrior who will free his people from foreign oppression.

On the island of [Labuan](/article/en/Labuan), home of the British consulate, he meets the daughter of the consul, Marianna Guillonk (called Marianne in some adaptations), known as the "Pearl of Labuan" for her beauty and indomitable nature whereby she rejects all of her rich suitors. Their encounter awakens in her a sense of adventure that she is unable to express within the strict Victorian societal norms and brings her closer to Sandokan, with whom she shares an endless struggle for freedom. 

However, standing between the two is Lord James Brooke, a charming pirate hunter and adventurer at the helm of the Royalist frigate, who is ready to do anything to capture Sandokan and win Marianna's heart. At the heart of the Bornean jungle, everyone will finally face a choice: Marianna will have to overcome her doubts and insecurities and choose between Brooke and Sandokan; Brooke's ambitions will clash with his vulnerabilities; and Sandokan, a simple pirate living day by day, will discover his true identity and become the "Tiger of Malaysia."

## Characters and Cast

### Main Cast

- **Can Yaman** as **Sandokan**, a Malay pirate raised on the island of Singapore, which he freed from English invaders. Adopted as a child, he is unaware of his origins, which he discovers during the series; he turns out to be the orphaned son of a [Dayak](/article/en/Dayak_people) warrior, who was nicknamed the Tiger.

- **Alanah Bloor** as **Lady Marianna Guillonk**, the daughter of the consul stationed in Labuan and Sandokan's love interest. After being kidnapped by Sandokan and his pirates, she discovers a reality different from what she imagined about British colonization of the peoples of Borneo.

- **Alessandro Preziosi** as **Yanez de Gomera**, an adventurer and Sandokan's fraternal friend. In this adaptation, he is a former missionary who lost his faith after witnessing the massacre of a tribe by oppressors in the Amazon.

- **Ed Westwick** as **Lord James Brooke**, Sandokan's main enemy and a famous pirate hunter at the helm of the Royalist, as well as his rival for Marianna's love. Raised in the Indian colonies by a Hindu mother and English father, he had to hide his mixed heritage. Because of this, he developed an opium addiction.

- **Madeleine Price** as **Sani**, Marianna's indigenous servant who joins Sandokan, encouraging him to free her people, including her brother who is imprisoned in the antimony mines. She loses her life due to a cannon wound after freeing her brother and other slaves from the mines, but not before declaring her love to Emilio.

- **Owen Teale** as **Lord Guillonk**, Marianna's father in this version (while in the novel he was her uncle), and is responsible for the death of Sandokan's parents. When Marianna discovers his involvement, he shows no signs of remorse, continuing to claim it was necessary for "progress."

- **John Hannah** as **Sergeant Murray**, Sandokan's enemy but also the one who, without knowing it, saved his life as a child. The only witness to that massacre for which he has always felt guilty, he helps Marianna to help Sandokan and herself escape.

- **Matt McCooey** as **Sultan Muda Hashim of Brunei**, sworn enemy of the Dayak tribes whom he enslaved to dig in the antimony mines. As a young man, together with the young Lord Guillonk, he took part in the extermination of Sandokan's original family. Cruel and ruthless, willing to do anything to maintain power.

- **Gilberto Gliozzi** as **Sambigliong**, Yanez's right-hand man. He survived having his throat cut, which left him mute. Yanez understands his language.

- **Samuele Segreto** as **Emilio**, the youngest member of Sandokan's crew, always intent on transcribing their adventures in his notebook. He falls in love with Sani, but their story is destined not to have a happy ending. As his name and the fact that he writes a diary narrating the deeds of his friends suggest, he is probably a tribute to Emilio Salgari himself.

## Episodes

The first season consists of eight episodes, which were broadcast in Italy over three weeks from December 1 to 16, 2025.

## Production

### Development and Casting

Production company [Lux Vide](/article/en/Lux_Vide) announced the series on May 26, 2022, and selected Can Yaman to play the titular character and Luca Argentero as Yanez. The miniseries was the idea of Lux Vide CEO Luca Bernabei, and its distribution arrangement outside of Italy is held with Fremantle, its parent company. In Spain, Mediaset España holds the rights instead.

On April 18, 2024, [Variety](/article/en/Variety_(magazine)) reported that several big-name actors (Ed Westwick, John Hannah, Alanah Bloor) had joined Can Yaman as part of the pool of actors in the new miniseries. Argentero was replaced by Alessandro Preziosi in the role of Yanez.

Following the successful broadcast of the first two episodes on December 1, 2025, it was announced that a second season was set to be produced and released by 2027, featuring the same main cast plus additional characters, and would be filmed starting in May 2026. In its development stage (before filming) in early 2026, the producers are trying to find a filming location for Mompracem, and there is the possibility of [Kabir Bedi](/article/en/Kabir_Bedi), who played the titular character in the original series, making a cameo.

### Filming

Filming started on April 22, 2024, in Formello, near Rome, where Lux Vide opened its new studio complex. The series was also shot in other locations in Lazio, Tuscany, and Calabria; the latter region was where Labuan was recreated, using funds from the Calabria Film Commission. Filming in Calabria started on May 27, following the building of an industrial backlot in the city of [Lamezia Terme](/article/en/Lamezia_Terme). Local shooting started in Le Castella, Capo Rizzuto, Crotone.

The Formello studios, where the initial scenes were shot, had three ships built on purpose for the series, including a 360-degree LED infrastructure to simulate oceans or weather conditions such as storms. Several cave scenes were shot at underground Roman cisterns in [Albano Laziale](/article/en/Albano_Laziale). Most of the jungle scenes were recreated in Parco Laghi dei Reali and Chia Falls. It was also used for most of the indoor locations, such as the consulate of Labuan, the prisons, and Singapore. In Tuscany, [Sammezzano Castle](/article/en/Sammezzano_Castle) was used as the palace of the Sultan of Brunei. The Lamezia Terme backlot was used for most scenes set in Labuan.

A panoramic pier was built in Le Castella, while action and persecution scenes were shot in [Tropea](/article/en/Tropea) and Capo Vaticano. Some elements of the sets were mixed with the natural environment of Vibo Marina and Gizzeria. The Malaysian swamps were recreated at the coastal lakes of Gizzeria in Calabria. Other locations included the Aragonese castle of Isola di Capo Rizzuto.

Overseas, some scenes were shot on location in the French overseas department of [Réunion](/article/en/Réunion); Thailand was used mostly to produce visual elements. By early September 2024, the cast and crew were already on location in Réunion. Using LED panels, elements of the ocean and sunsets around Thailand were later dispatched to the Italian studios.

The Calabria Film Commission injected €800,000 into its production, but there are fewer scenes compared to those shot in Sammezzano and in Lazio, according to Domani, a local newspaper. This was seen with criticism from locals, even though the original plans were to "show Calabria to the world."

In the summer of 2025, it was anticipated that in the event of a second season the series would be filmed again in Calabria.

### Previews

A preview was shown on February 28, 2025, during Fremantle Presents, Fremantle's upfront event at the London TV Screenings.

On June 24, 2025, the series was presented at the Italian Global Series Festival in Riccione.

### Soundtrack

The musical score for the series was assigned to and performed by Italian band [Calibro 35](/article/en/Calibro_35). For the opening theme, the group chose to cover the popular theme from the 1976 series, composed by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis (aka [Oliver Onions](/article/en/Oliver_Onions_(band))), which remained widely associated with Sandokan among Italians.

## Release

The eight episodes of the series aired in Italy on Rai 1 and RaiPlay over three weeks from December 1 to 16, 2025. Following the original run, the series was made available on Disney+ on January 17, 2026, which eased its international distribution.

In Portugal, the series aired on AXN in December 2025. It was previewed locally at Tribeca Festival Lisbon in October, where Ed Westwick was present.

Rights are held by [Central European Media Enterprises](/article/en/Central_European_Media_Enterprises) in former Yugoslav countries, including Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it premiered on December 2, 2025, on the Voyo streaming service. 

At the 2025 Asian Television Forum, Fremantle sold the series to Hits Now in Southeast Asia, Star Entertainment in India, and LG U+ in Korea.

## Reception

Reception of the series in Italy has been mixed. The Italian edition of [Vanity Fair](/article/en/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)) did an overall positive review but criticized the first twenty minutes of the first episode for its excessive action scenes, calling it "unnecessarily confusing" and showing a problem of the media landscape in 2025. However, it later gained impulse as the characters were being presented one by one. The magazine also called for Rai 1 to increase the amount of original action series, owing to the 34% share of the first two episodes, calling the series "a breath of fresh air" in a channel whose main fiction titles are mostly criminal series. It defined the series as "a breath of fresh air on a network that now offers nothing but clergy members, commissioners, and prosecutors solving mysteries."

Cinema Serie TV called it "a complex test," which does not replace the 1976 series but rather tries establishing dialogue with it, by having more creative freedom instead of being a mere recreation. Can Yaman's performance was touted as being a thing in its own right instead of replicating the original.

The series received multi-million viewership figures, with an average of four million viewers tuning in. The first episode gathered 5,775,000 viewers with a 33.9% share, while the series closed with an average of 25.4% share and over 4 million viewers. This has been attributed to a "nostalgia effect" of the 1976 series or the presence of Can Yaman.
