# Narutomaki

**Narutomaki** (鳴門巻き/なると巻き) or **naruto** (ナルト/なると) is a type of [kamaboko](/article/en/Kamaboko), or [cured fish surimi](/article/en/Surimi) produced in [Japan](/article/en/Japan). Each cloud-shaped or ring-shaped slice of naruto features a distinctive spiral pattern in pink or red on a white background, which is meant to resemble the famous [Naruto whirlpools](/article/en/Naruto_Strait) in the [Naruto Strait](/article/en/Naruto_Strait) between [Awaji Island](/article/en/Awaji_Island) and [Naruto](/article/en/Naruto,_Tokushima), [Tokushima Prefecture](/article/en/Tokushima_Prefecture) on [Shikoku Island](/article/en/Shikoku) in Japan.

## Etymology and Naming

The product is named after the distinctive whirlpools (naruto-no-uzushio) found in the [Naruto Strait](/article/en/Naruto_Strait). The name "narutomaki" literally means "rolled naruto," while the abbreviated form "naruto" refers to the product itself. Interestingly, narutomaki also inspired the name of [Naruto Uzumaki](/article/en/Naruto_Uzumaki), the protagonist of the [Naruto](/article/en/Naruto) manga series.

## History and Origins

### Early Development

[Kamaboko](/article/en/Kamaboko) has been known in Japan from at least 1115 CE, making it one of Japan's oldest processed foods. It gradually spread among the common population during the [Edo period](/article/en/Edo_period) (1600–1867).

The specific variant known as narutomaki has unclear origins, though one theory suggests it descended from the "five-color rolls" (goshiki-maki) of the late Edo period, with narutomaki representing what remains of only the red roll from this tradition that survived independently into the modern era.

### Modern Development

In 1823, steamed surimi with a spiral pattern was invented and formally named "naruto kamaboko," distinguishing it from "mushi kamaboko," which became known as kamaboko proper. The product became increasingly common as an ingredient in [ramen](/article/en/Ramen) during the 20th century, eventually becoming one of the most iconic ramen toppings in [Japan](/article/en/Japan).

### Chemical Production Controversy

In the 1960s, [hydrogen peroxide](/article/en/Hydrogen_peroxide) was introduced for bleaching the white surimi in commercially produced narutomaki, leading to public health concerns. This prompted scientific investigation into residual content and manufacturing methods.

## Characteristics and Appearance

### Structure

Narutomaki is an elongated cylindrical fish cake product made using two colors of surimi: white exterior and red or pink interior (the pink color is typically created using food coloring rather than natural ingredients). Compared to ordinary kamaboko, narutomaki contains more binder, which results in less pronounced fish flavor and a somewhat powdery texture.

### Pattern and Presentation

The defining characteristic of narutomaki is the spiral pattern visible on the cross-section when sliced. The spiral is typically formed to resemble the character "の" (no), which is sometimes considered the "front" side, possibly for auspicious reasons—though this orientation actually differs from the pattern of Naruto's actual whirlpools.

Most examples have a serrated or gear-like appearance around the edges. Historically, narutomaki was sold wrapped in straw mats; when used, the straw would be removed and the product sliced into rings to create this distinctive gear-like appearance. Modern mass-produced items are now shaped by specialized machinery to achieve this effect.

### Regional Variations

The standard type nationally features a white exterior with a pink spiral interior. However, regional variations exist:

* In [Kyushu](/article/en/Kyushu) and other southern regions, varieties with a red exterior exist, called "chiyo-maki" (知代巻き). These are considered closer to the original form of narutomaki, as they more directly reflect the original practice of layering and rolling two-colored fish paste. Similar red-exterior versions are a specialty of [Toyama Prefecture](/article/en/Toyama_Prefecture).

* In [Hokkaido](/article/en/Hokkaido) and the [Tohoku](/article/en/Tohoku) region, three-color versions featuring red and green spirals on the outside are common.

* Narutomaki sold overseas, particularly in [Hawaii](/article/en/Hawaii), typically features red exteriors with vivid coloring, believed to reflect the original form from the [Meiji](/article/en/Meiji_Restoration) and [Taisho](/article/en/Taisho) periods when Japanese immigrants introduced the product.

* Black versions made with [bamboo charcoal](/article/en/Bamboo_charcoal) also exist as specialty variants.

### Taste and Use

Due to its higher binder content and lower fish content, narutomaki is rarely eaten alone and is primarily used as a garnish or ingredient in cooking rather than as a standalone dish.

## Manufacturing

### Historical Methods

In early versions of narutomaki, the spiral pattern was created by placing a sheet of [nori](/article/en/Nori) (seaweed) on top of white surimi before rolling and steaming.

### Modern Production

In the 21st century, narutomaki is typically made from [frozen surimi](/article/en/Surimi). The manufacturing process involves:

1. Creating a sheet of white surimi
2. Covering it with a thin layer of pink-colored surimi
3. Rolling the combined sheets tightly
4. Steaming the rolled surimi to set it
5. Cooling and slicing into individual rings

The decorative cuts around the edges are made either manually or by specialized machinery, creating the characteristic gear-like appearance.

### Production Centers

Approximately 90% of narutomaki produced in Japan comes from [Yaizu](/article/en/Yaizu), [Shizuoka](/article/en/Shizuoka) Prefecture, making it the primary center of production and a location strongly associated with the product.

## Culinary Uses

### Primary Applications

Naruto is a common and iconic topping on [Japanese noodles](/article/en/Japanese_noodles), particularly:

* [Ramen](/article/en/Ramen) - where it serves as one of the most recognizable toppings
* [Udon](/article/en/Udon) - in various regional preparations
* Cold ramen (hiyamen) - a summer variation

Naruto is particularly indispensable in [Tokyo ramen](/article/en/Tokyo_ramen), though its use declined somewhat in the 2000s due to efforts to avoid appearing old-fashioned.

### Regional and Secondary Uses

In various regions of [Japan](/article/en/Japan), narutomaki is also used in:

* [Oden](/article/en/Oden) - Japanese hot pot stew
* Nimono - Japanese simmered dishes
* Fried rice (chahan) - in Japanese-style [Chinese restaurants](/article/en/Chinese_cuisine_in_Japan)
* Chinese rice bowls (donburi)

## Cultural Significance

### Digital Representation

Narutomaki has its own [Unicode](/article/en/Unicode) emoji: 🍥 (U+1F365), making it one of the few specific food items with dedicated emoji representation.

### Linguistic Use

The word is also used as [slang](/article/en/Slang) terminology for the [at sign](/article/en/At_sign) "@" in [Japanese](/article/en/Japanese_language), likely due to the visual similarity between the spiral pattern and the symbol's circular shape.

### Popular Culture

The [Naruto](/article/en/Naruto) manga series, created by [Masashi Kishimoto](/article/en/Masashi_Kishimoto), took its name from narutomaki and the Naruto Strait, with the protagonist [Naruto Uzumaki](/article/en/Naruto_Uzumaki) being named after the food.

### Brand Ambassadors

In [Japan](/article/en/Japan), talent [Yoshizumi Ishihara](/article/en/Yoshizumi_Ishihara) serves as the official "Naruto Ambassador," promoting the product and its cultural significance.
