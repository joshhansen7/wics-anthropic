# High-Speed Rail in Egypt

Egypt is currently developing a comprehensive high-speed rail network, known as the "Hapi" project (named after the ancient Egyptian god of the Nile). While there are no operational high-speed rail services as of 2024, a major project was launched in 2018 to construct a network of high-speed railway lines spanning approximately 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) across the country. This ambitious infrastructure project represents one of the largest transportation initiatives in Egypt's modern history and aims to revolutionize passenger and freight transport throughout the country.

## Overview

The Egyptian high-speed rail network is being developed to connect major cities and coastal areas, creating a modern transportation backbone for the nation. Once completed, the system will significantly reduce travel times between major population centers, reduce carbon emissions, and facilitate economic development by improving the movement of people and goods.

The existing intercity railway network in Egypt, largely built during the British colonial era, has suffered from delayed modernization and insufficient maintenance, resulting in frequent accidents and inadequate service. The high-speed rail project aims to address these issues by creating an entirely new, modern rail system using the latest technology.

The project is being established by a consortium led by German company Siemens Mobility, together with Egyptian companies Arab Contractors and Orascom Construction. In this partnership, Siemens is responsible for all electrical and mechanical systems, signaling, control systems, and the manufacturing and supply of electric trains, as well as establishing maintenance workshops and installing equipment. The Egyptian partners, Arab Contractors and Orascom Construction, are handling civil works including earthworks, bridges, track installation, passenger terminals, and fencing. The French company Systra serves as the general consultant for the entire project.

Once completed, the railway system will be operated and maintained by a consortium of Deutsche Bahn (through its subsidiary DB International Operations) and the Egyptian company Elsewedy Electric under a 15-year contract, renewable for another 15 years, for a potential total of 30 years.

## History

On March 12, 2018, Egypt's Transport Minister Hisham Arafat announced that Egypt was in the process of launching a new high-speed railway network connecting the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, with the participation of more than 10 international companies.

In September 2020, a Chinese-Egyptian consortium consisting of China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), Egyptian Samcrete, and the Arab Organization for Industrialization won a $9 billion contract to build a 543 km high-speed railway line capable of speeds up to 250 km/h. Under this plan, electric trains would be manufactured in Port Said with Chinese technology transfer to Egypt.

However, in January 2021, Egypt's authorities signed a declaration of intent with a consortium led by Germany's Siemens Mobility for the development of the high-speed rail network. The first contract worth €4.5 billion (approximately $4.5 billion) for 660 km of high-speed railway was issued in September 2021. In May 2022, the contract was extended to encompass the complete 2,000 km network with a budget totaling €8.1 billion (approximately $8.7 billion).

Besides Siemens, other companies that had bid for the construction of the network included Chinese CCECC, French Alstom, and Egyptian companies Arab Organization for Industrialization and Samcrete.

In November 2022, DB International Operations, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, and the Egyptian Elsewedy Electric won the contract to operate and maintain Egypt's high-speed rail network after completion.

## Network Design

The high-speed rail network in Egypt is being built to standard gauge (1,435 mm), which is already used in Egypt's conventional rail network. The system is designed for a maximum speed of 250 km/h and will be electrified with 25 kV / 50 Hz overhead catenary. The lines will be secured using the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2.

The network will serve both passenger and freight transport, with passenger trains operating during daytime hours and freight services primarily at night. The entire network is projected to cost approximately $23 billion and will span over 2,000 km with about 60 stations.

## Train Lines

The high-speed rail network in Egypt consists of three main lines (sometimes referred to as four lines in some sources), each color-coded for ease of reference:

### Green Line (Ain Sokhna - Marsa Matruh)

The first line, referred to as the "Green Line," will connect the city of Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea coast in Suez Governorate with Marsa Matruh city on the Mediterranean coast in Matruh Governorate, with a total length of 660 km. This line is sometimes called the "Railway Suez Canal" due to its role in connecting the two seas.

The Green Line begins at Marsa Matruh on the Mediterranean Sea, passes through Al-Alamein, Borg El Arab, then to Wadi El Natroun, on to the 6th of October City, through southern Cairo to the New Administrative Capital, and ends in Ain Sokhna on the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea.

This line costs approximately $4.45 billion and will operate 15 high-speed trains with a design speed of 250 km/h and an operational speed of 230 km/h, 24 regional trains with an operational speed of 160 km/h, and 15 freight locomotives with an operational speed of 120 km/h. The journey time by high-speed train from start to finish will be about 4 hours.

The Green Line will intersect with the [Light Rail Transit (LRT)](/article/en/Cairo_Light_Rail_Transit) at the Central Train Station in the New Administrative Capital, with the Blue Line at an interchange station in Hadayek October City, and with the second line of [Cairo Monorail](/article/en/Cairo_Monorail) at the Engineers Syndicate Station in 6th of October City.

Construction on this line began in May 2021 and is scheduled to be operational by December 2024, though some sources indicate a 2027 completion date. The line is designed to carry up to 30 million passengers annually, cut travel times in half, and reduce carbon emissions by 70% compared to other transportation modes.

#### Passenger Stations

The Green Line has 21 stations (10 high-speed stations + 11 regional stations):

1. Ain Sokhna (high-speed)
2. Administrative Capital (high-speed)
3. Mohamed Naguib
4. Cairo (high-speed)
5. Giza
6. Hadayek October (high-speed, interchange with Blue Line)
7. 6th of October
8. New Sphinx
9. Sadat City (high-speed)
10. Wadi El Natrun
11. New Nobaria
12. Alexandria (high-speed)
13. Borg El Arab

17. El Dabaa (high-speed)
18. Swan Lake
19. Ras El Hekma (high-speed)
20. Almaza Bay
21. Marsa Matruh (high-speed)

### Blue Line (6th of October City - Abu Simbel)

The second line, known as the "Blue Line," will stretch from 6th of October City (or Hadayek October City in Giza Governorate) through Fayoum, Minya, Aswan, and Abu Simbel, covering approximately 1,100 km on the west bank of the Nile River.

The initial cost of the project exceeds $6 billion. The Blue Line will operate 19 high-speed trains with a design speed of 230 km/h, 45 regional trains at 160 km/h, and 20 freight locomotives at 120 km/h. The journey time by high-speed train from start to finish will be about 5 hours.

The train will intersect with the Green Line at an interchange station in Hadayek October City, and with the Red Line at an interchange station in Qena City. Survey and construction work for this line began in March 2022, focusing initially on areas around 6th of October City and Fayoum.

In May 2022, an extension of this line was announced from Aswan through Abu Simbel to Toshka and Sharq El Owainat in the Western Desert, as well as an extension to Wadi Halfa in [Sudan](/article/en/Sudan). The [Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development](/article/en/Kuwait_Fund_for_Arab_Economic_Development) signed a $2.45 million agreement for a feasibility study for a 283.5 km line from Aswan to Toshka and Abu Simbel, as well as the 80 km extension to Sudan, which includes a 6 km bridge across [Lake Nasser](/article/en/Lake_Nasser).

#### Passenger Stations

The Blue Line has 36 stations (10 high-speed stations + 26 regional stations):

High-speed stations:
1. Hadayek October (interchange station with Green Line)
2. Fayoum/Beni Suef
3. Minya
4. Assiut
5. Sohag
6. Qena (interchange station with Red Line)
7. Luxor
8. Edfu
9. Aswan Airport
10. Toshka
11. Abu Simbel

Regional stations include: El Ayat, El Fashn, El Adwa, Beni Mazar, Samalut, Abu Qurqas, Mallawi, Dairut, El Qusiya, Manfalut, Abutig, El Ghanayem, Tahta, Juhayna, Abydos, Farshout, Nag Hammadi, Dishna, Qus, Armant, Esna, El Sebaeya, Kalabsha, Daraw, New Aswan, and Medcom.

### Red Line (Qena - Safaga)

The third line, known as the "Red Line," will connect Qena city in Upper Egypt on the Nile River with the cities of Hurghada and Safaga on the Red Sea coast in the Red Sea Governorate, with a total length of 225 km.

The line will cost approximately $2.7 billion with a construction time of two years. It will operate 6 high-speed trains with a design speed of 230 km/h, 16 regional trains at 160 km/h, and 6 freight locomotives at 120 km/h. The Red Line will intersect with the Blue Line at an interchange station in Qena city.

#### Passenger Stations

The Red Line has 4 stations (3 high-speed stations and 1 regional station):
1. Qena (interchange station with Blue Line)
2. Hurghada
3. Sahl Hasheesh (regional)
4. Safaga

### Fourth Line (West Port Said - New Abu Qir)

Some sources, particularly the Arabic Wikipedia, mention a fourth line that would extend along the northeastern coast from west of Port Said port at the entrance of the [Suez Canal](/article/en/Suez_Canal) to the New Abu Qir Port.

This line would follow the existing railway line between Port Said and Ismailia, then extend along the international coastal road to the Furniture City in Damietta, then Damietta Port, New Damietta and the dry port, then Gamasa, passing through New Mansoura City, Delta Marina and Burullus, reaching New Rashid after passing through Motobas, and finally to the New Abu Qir Port where it would exchange service with the [Alexandria Metro](/article/en/Alexandria_Metro).

However, this fourth line does not appear consistently across all sources and may represent future expansion plans rather than part of the current contracted project.

## Rolling Stock

Siemens will supply the following vehicles for the Egyptian high-speed rail network, with production beginning sequentially from 2023:

### Passenger Trains

- **Velaro High-Speed Trains**: 41 eight-car Siemens Velaro multiple-unit trains will be used for long-distance services. These trains are designed for a maximum commercial speed of 230 km/h. In July 2024, some of these vehicles were already spotted in Germany, and in May 2024, the first manufactured vehicles were presented to the press in Wildenrath, Germany.

- **Desiro Regional Trains**: 94 four-car Siemens Desiro HC (High Capacity) multiple-unit trains will be used for regional services. These trains will feature double-decker cars in the middle sections and are designed for a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.

### Freight Locomotives

- **Vectron Locomotives**: 41 Siemens Vectron electric locomotives will be used for freight services, with a maximum commercial speed of 120 km/h.

## Operations and Maintenance

In November 2022, the [National Authority for Tunnels](/article/en/National_Authority_for_Tunnels) assigned the management of the three high-speed electric train lines to a consortium of the German Railway Company (Deutsche Bahn, through its subsidiary DB International Operations) and Elsewedy Electric for 15 years, renewable for another 15 years, for a total potential contract period of 30 years.

Test runs are scheduled to begin in 2024, and the first section of the Marsa Matruh–Ain Sokhna line – likely Alexandria–Cairo – is expected to open in 2026, with full network operations following in subsequent years.

## Future Projects

Several extensions to the primary high-speed rail network have been proposed or are in planning stages:

### Libya Extension

The intention to build an extension westward from Marsa Matruh through El Negaila to Sallum on the [Libyan](/article/en/Libya) border, and potentially on to [Benghazi](/article/en/Benghazi) in Libya, was announced by Egyptian Transport Minister Kamel Al-Wazir in November 2020 and reconfirmed by the Libyan-Egyptian Chamber of Commerce on January 18, 2021. An extension to [Siwa Oasis](/article/en/Siwa_Oasis) was also mentioned.

These extensions are part of the Egyptian government's larger plan to build political and economic links with Libya, though the political instability in Libya may affect the feasibility of cross-border extensions in the near term.

### Sudan Extension

As mentioned earlier, plans exist to extend the Blue Line from Abu Simbel to Wadi Halfa in Sudan, which would include a 6 km bridge across Lake Nasser. This extension is part of Egypt's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with Sudan.

## Significance and Impact

The high-speed rail project is considered one of the elements of Egypt's clean transportation system, which includes the [Alexandria Tram](/article/en/Alexandria_Tram), [Alexandria Metro](/article/en/Alexandria_Metro), [Cairo Metro](/article/en/Cairo_Metro), [Monorail](/article/en/Cairo_Monorail), [Light Rail Transit (LRT)](/article/en/Cairo_Light_Rail_Transit), and [Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)](/article/en/Bus_Rapid_Transit).

The new rail network is expected to significantly improve transportation efficiency in Egypt, reduce dependency on road transport, decrease carbon emissions, and stimulate economic development along its corridors. The project is also creating thousands of jobs for Egyptians during the construction phase and will continue to provide employment opportunities during operations.
