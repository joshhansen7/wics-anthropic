# Stupidity

Stupidity is a lack of intelligence, understanding, reason, or wit. It denotes an inability to learn, think independently, and make rational decisions across many aspects of life. Stupidity can be innate, assumed, or reactive (such as a response to grief or psychological trauma). The word "stupid" comes from the Latin word *stupere*. Characters displaying stupidity are often employed in fictional narratives for comedic purposes. Walter B. Pitkin described stupidity as "evil," while William Blake and Carl Jung took a more romantic view, believing that stupidity could be the mother of wisdom.

## Etymology

The root word "stupid," which can serve as an adjective or noun, comes from the Latin verb *stupere*, meaning to be numb or astonished, and is related to [stupor](/article/en/Stupor). In Roman culture, the *stupidus* was the professional fall guy in the theatrical mimes.

According to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, the words "stupid" and "stupidity" entered the English language in 1541. Since then, stupidity has taken place along with "fool," "idiot," "dumb," "moron," and related concepts as a pejorative for misdeeds, whether purposeful or accidental, due to absence of mental capacity.

In Arabic, a stupid person is known by several labels such as fool, imbecile, idiot, and simpleton (from the Arabic Wikipedia).

## Definition

Stupidity is a quality or state of being stupid, or an act or idea that exhibits properties of being stupid. In a character study of "The Stupid Man" attributed to the Greek philosopher [Theophrastus](/article/en/Theophrastus) (c. 371 – c. 287 BC), stupidity was defined as "mental slowness in speech or action." The modern English word "stupid" has a broad range of application, from being slow of mind (indicating a lack of intelligence, care or reason), dullness of feeling or sensation (torpidity, senselessness, insensitivity), or lacking interest or point (vexing, exasperating). It can either imply a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning, or a temporary state of daze, or slow-mindedness.

In *Understanding Stupidity*, James F. Welles defines stupidity this way: "The term may be used to designate a mentality which is considered to be informed, deliberate and maladaptive." Welles distinguishes stupidity from ignorance, where stupidity means one must know they are acting in their own worst interest in that it must be a choice, not a forced act or accident. Lastly, it requires the activity to be maladaptive, in that it is in the worst interest of the actor, and specifically done to prevent adaptation to new data or existing circumstances.

One of the most important characteristics of stupidity is irrationality; it indicates an inability to understand information correctly (as noted in the Arabic version).

In the narrower sense, as noted in the German Wikipedia, stupidity refers to the inadequate ability to draw appropriate conclusions from perceptions or to learn. This deficiency is partly based on:
- Ignorance of facts necessary for forming a judgment
- Deficient intelligence or mental training
- A certain inertia and sluggishness in comprehension
- Slowness in combining available facts

In this sense, [Immanuel Kant](/article/en/Immanuel_Kant) calls the "lack of judgment" as "what one calls stupidity," and postulates that "such a defect... cannot be remedied." Further causes lie in the emotional realm (emotional resistance to insights, dependence on opinion leaders) and in indoctrination and manipulation by others.

## Measurement

There are various tests to measure [intelligence quotient (IQ)](/article/en/Intelligence_quotient), as well as tests that measure aptitude, such as the United States Marine Corps' required General Classification Test (GCT), and the Army General Classification Test.

Researchers Michael Klein and Matthew Cancian have reported a declining aptitude among college educated applicants to the Marine Corps over the past 34 years, although this effect was not observed in the general enlisted population.

Researchers Michael J. McFarland, Matt E. Hauer, and Aaron Reuben report those born between 1951 and 1980 may have lost an average of 2.6 IQ points from exposure to [leaded gasoline](/article/en/Tetraethyllead).

## Types and Perspectives on Stupidity

### Physiological and Borderline Stupidity

The Russian Wikipedia notes that stupidity may correspond to a low degree of intellectual development, without reaching the level of a physical deviation — mild mental retardation (debility). In 1960, psychiatrists Tadeusz Bilikiewicz and R. Lemke identified "physiological stupidity" — an intellectual level that lies on the border between normal and pathological. Bilikiewicz considered hypophrenia as the lower boundary of normal intelligence, but did not consider it psychopathology. V. P. Serbsky contrasted "physiological stupidity" with [oligophrenia](/article/en/Oligophrenia) (mental retardation).

P. B. Gannushkin identified "psychopaths" (individuals with personality disorders) called "constitutionally-stupid." Their distinctive feature is stupidity, congenital mental insufficiency that does not reach the state of debility. Their intellectual state is assessed as being on the border between mental health and mental illness. From modern classifications, the closest concept is [borderline intellectual disability](/article/en/Borderline_intellectual_functioning) ("borderline intellectual functioning" in the American classification DSM-5, 2013).

A variety of physiological stupidity or constitutionally-stupid type of psychopathy is "salon idiocy" (German: *Salon Blödsinn*), identified by [Eugen Bleuler](/article/en/Eugen_Bleuler), in which externally educated but template-based speech and acquired manners mask a low intellectual level.

### Intellectual Stupidity

[Otto Fenichel](/article/en/Otto_Fenichel) maintained that "quite a percentage of so-called feeble-mindedness turns out to be pseudo-debility, conditioned by inhibition ... Every intellect begins to show weakness when affective motives are working against it." He suggests that "people become stupid ad hoc, that is, when they do not want to understand, where understanding would cause anxiety or guilt feeling, or would endanger an existing neurotic equilibrium."

In rather different fashion, [Doris Lessing](/article/en/Doris_Lessing) argued that "there is no fool like an intellectual ... a kind of clever stupidity, bred out of a line of logic in the head, nothing to do with experience."

[Gilbert Ryle](/article/en/Gilbert_Ryle) wrote that stupidity and ignorance are things of different sorts, as a person skilled in arguments and jokes may struggle to accommodate elementary truths in their head.

### Playing Stupid

[Eric Berne](/article/en/Eric_Berne) described the game of "Stupid" as having "the thesis...'I laugh with you at my own clumsiness and stupidity.'" He points out that the player has the advantage of lowering other people's expectations, and so evading responsibility and work; but that he or she may still come through under pressure, like the proverbially stupid younger son.

[Wilfred Bion](/article/en/Wilfred_Bion) considered that psychological projection created a barrier against learning anything new, and thus its own form of pseudo-stupidity.

### Persisting in Folly

In the Romantic reaction to Enlightenment wisdom, a valorisation of the irrational, the foolish, and the stupid emerged, as in [William Blake's](/article/en/William_Blake) dictum that "if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise"; or [Jung's](/article/en/Carl_Jung) belief that "it requires no art to become stupid; the whole art lies in extracting wisdom from stupidity. Stupidity is the mother of the wise, but cleverness never."

Similarly, [Michel Foucault](/article/en/Michel_Foucault) argued for the necessity of stupidity to re-connect with what our articulate categories exclude, to recapture the alterity of difference.

The German Wikipedia notes an interesting dimension of stupidity highlighted in Wander's German Dictionary of Proverbs from 1866: In the extensive collection of proverbs on the topic, it becomes clear that there are also fools who muddle through and get far ("Half the world belongs to the stupid"; "The stupid have all the luck"; "The dumbest farmers harvest the largest potatoes").

### "Dumbing Down"

The German Wikipedia notes that stupidity can be learned and one can be educated to stupidity (so-called "dumbing down"), e.g., through passed-on prejudices, groupthink in teams, or media influences, as well as through lack of stimulation from (adult) persons. Limitations and decay of verbalization ability play an essential role: The use of unreflected phrases or euphemisms reduces the ability to judge. But not only stimulus poverty but also sensory overload can impair cognitive abilities and judgment. Manfred Spitzer speaks of "digital dementia" as a consequence of media flooding even of small children. Also, the desire for fun with growing displeasure with critical seriousness is considered a cause of dumbing down in the "fun society" with its tendency toward infantilization, according to Berman, among others, in a critical analysis of US mass culture. Television has, for the first time in history, ensured that the clever became envious of the stupid.

## Impact and Significance

In his book *A Short Introduction to the History of Stupidity* (1932), Walter B. Pitkin warns about the impact of stupid people:

> Stupidity can easily be proved the supreme Social Evil. Three factors combine to establish it as such. First and foremost, the number of stupid people is legion. Secondly, most of the power in business, finance, diplomacy and politics is in the hands of more or less stupid individuals. Finally, high abilities are often linked with serious stupidity.

[Dietrich Bonhoeffer](/article/en/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer) indicated stupidity to be "a more dangerous enemy of the good than evil" because there is no defense: "Neither protest nor force can touch it. Reasoning is of no use. Facts that contradict personal prejudices can simply be disbelieved." The great danger of stupidity manifests itself when it affects larger groups. In a larger group, "the stupid person will also be capable of any evil and at the same time incapable of seeing that it is evil."

According to [Carlo Cipolla](/article/en/Carlo_M._Cipolla), the efforts of stupid people are counterproductive to their own and other's interest. He maintains that reasonable people cannot imagine or understand unreasonable behavior making stupid people dangerous and damaging, even potentially more dangerous than a "bandit" whose action at least has a rational goal, namely his benefit.

[Robert Musil](/article/en/Robert_Musil) (1937) names the paradox that anyone who speaks about stupidity presupposes that they are above things, thus being clever, although precisely this presumption is considered a sign of stupidity (as noted in the German Wikipedia).

## Stupidity in Arts and Culture

### In Folk Science

According to the Latin Wikipedia, in the popular science of all cultures, there are short stories about stupidity: "A remarkably large number of simple stories told by illiterate people everywhere deal with stupid people and their ineptitudes." Those who study folk science categorize tale-types 1200-1349 as "numskull stories," and in motif indexes category J is for "the wise and the stupid."

### In Comedy

The fool or buffoon has been a central character in much comedy. Alford and Alford found that humor based on stupidity was prevalent in "more complex" societies as compared to some other forms of humor. Some analysis of [William Shakespeare's](/article/en/William_Shakespeare) comedy has found that his characters tend to hold mutually contradictory positions; because this implies a lack of careful analysis it indicates stupidity on their part.

Today there is a wide array of television shows that showcase stupidity such as [The Simpsons](/article/en/The_Simpsons). Goofball comedy is a class of naive, zany humour typified by actor [Leslie Nielsen](/article/en/Leslie_Nielsen).

### In Film

[Stupidity](/article/en/Stupidity_(film)) is a 2003 movie directed by Albert Nerenberg. It depicts examples and analyses of stupidity in modern society and media, and seeks "to explore the prospect that willful ignorance has increasingly become a strategy for success in the realms of politics and entertainment."

[Idiocracy](/article/en/Idiocracy), a Mike Judge film from 2006, explores a dystopian future America where a person of average IQ is cryogenically frozen and wakes up 500 years later to find that mankind, increasingly dependent on technology built by previous generations that it does not properly maintain or understand, has regressed in intelligence to the standards of current-era intellectual disability, and that he has become the de facto smartest person on Earth. Americans have become so stupid that society faces famine and collapse, and according to Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat, "...each laugh is tempered with the unsettling realization that [Judge's] vision of mankind's future might not be too far off the mark."

## Awards for Stupidity

The Latin Wikipedia mentions several awards for stupidity:

- [Darwin Awards](/article/en/Darwin_Awards), named after naturalist and evolutionary theorist Charles Darwin, honor people who contribute to human evolution by removing themselves from the gene pool in an exceptionally foolish manner.
- The Universal Stupidity Awards are granted in several categories: saying, state of affairs, trend, product; person, film, and media outlet.
- The [Ig Nobel Prizes](/article/en/Ig_Nobel_Prize) (a portmanteau of the Nobel name and the word "ignoble") are awarded for trivial investigations in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, public health, engineering, biology, mathematics, and veterinary medicine. More extreme examples include whether cows with names give more milk than unnamed cows, if diamond films can be created from tequila, and why pregnant women don't tip over. The most harmful societal stupidity is academic stupidity, variously defined as "error in academic research," "deluding by creating empty notions," "scientific (magical) things as perceived by simple observers," "false things," and "erroneous mental images."
