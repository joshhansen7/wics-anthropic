The film premiered as the opening film of the [82nd Venice International Film Festival](/article/en/82nd_Venice_International_Film_Festival) on 27 August 2025, where it competed for the [Golden Lion](/article/en/Golden_Lion). Servillo won the [Volpi Cup for Best Actor](/article/en/Volpi_Cup). It received theatrical release in [Italy](/article/en/Italy) on 15 January 2026.

## Plot

President of the [Italian Republic](/article/en/Italian_Republic) Mariano De Santis is nearing the end of his term, having safely guided the country through six state crises. A widower, former legal expert, and devout [Catholic](/article/en/Catholic_Church), he is nicknamed "Reinforced Concrete" for his inflexibility and immovable character. De Santis is constantly accompanied by his daughter Dorotea, also a jurist who has drafted a law legalizing [euthanasia](/article/en/Euthanasia), and Colonel Massimo Labaro, a carabinieri officer. His only concession to private life includes dinners with his longtime friend Coco Valori, an effusive art critic.

De Santis lives in perpetual memory of his deceased wife Aurora, haunted by awareness of her infidelity forty years earlier; he has never learned the identity of her lover. During his white semester (the final six months of a presidential term), De Santis faces three major moral dilemmas: whether to sign the euthanasia law into effect, and whether to grant pardons to two individuals convicted of murder under potentially mitigating circumstances.

The first pardon petition concerns Professor Cristiano Arpa, who murdered his wife suffering from [Alzheimer's disease](/article/en/Alzheimer_disease) and subsequently allowed himself to die by refusing food. His former students, who regard him as wise and temperate, filed the pardon request. The second involves Isa Rocca, a woman imprisoned for stabbing her husband after fifteen years of domestic violence. Justice Minister Ugo Romani, De Santis's childhood friend and likely successor, suggests that De Santis carefully examine Rocca's case, revealing she is the niece of his companion. De Santis suspects Ugo may be Aurora's mysterious lover, though Coco denies this. Dorotea personally investigates Rocca's case, discovering the woman harbors no remorse and believes her act constituted a form of euthanasia, as her husband was incurable. Dorotea learns that Rocca has a lover waiting for her outside prison.

De Santis's deliberations are further complicated by discussions with the [Pope](/article/en/Pope), his personal friend, regarding the euthanasia law. When his beloved horse Elvis becomes incurably ill, De Santis requests it not be euthanized while he postpones his decisions—a point of contention with Colonel Labaro. The horse eventually dies, possibly euthanized by Labaro.

As his term concludes, Dorotea unexpectedly announces her departure to [Canada](/article/en/Canada) to join her brother, a contemporary music composer. Left alone, De Santis decides to personally address the outstanding matters. Shortly before his term ends, he reveals to Labaro his intention to resign two weeks early to become a Life Senator and participate in the presidential election.

De Santis attends a premiere at the [Scala Theater](/article/en/La_Scala) in [Milan](/article/en/Milan), where he receives an ovation from the public. Coco observes that despite his constant doubts, the Italian people love him; De Santis replies that they love the idea of legality rather than the person who transmitted it. Coco then reveals an unexpected truth: she was Aurora's lover, freeing Mariano from decades of uncertainty, though De Santis retains doubt about whether Coco spoke truthfully or out of pity.

After resigning from office, De Santis grants an interview to Vogue Italia, during which he reflects on his life and mistakes. He reveals that he signed the euthanasia law before leaving office, having matured the conviction that true "grace" is not achieving absolute certainty but having courage to make decisions despite doubt. He granted the pardon to Isa Rocca, believing her sincere, but denied it to Cristiano Arpa, whom he believes did not truly love his wife. De Santis retains uncertainty about whether Coco was truthful regarding Aurora.

Text cards conclude the film: Rocca and her new partner separated six months after the pardon; Arpa filed an independent pardon request after repeatedly refusing the one his former students proposed; Justice Minister Ugo Romani failed in his run for the Quirinal by a single vote, likely De Santis's.

## Production

### Development

The film was announced on 4 December 2024, with Sorrentino as writer and director. Sorrentino revealed that the film's inspiration derived from the real case of a man pardoned by Italian [President](/article/en/President_of_Italy) [Sergio Mattarella](/article/en/Sergio_Mattarella) after being convicted of murdering his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.

This marks Sorrentino's eleventh feature film as director. For Sorrentino and Servillo, it represents their seventh collaboration on a feature film. According to Sorrentino, he had wanted to create a "romantic film" with his favorite actor for twenty years, achieving this with *La grazia* while maintaining stylistic continuity rather than abruptly shifting from [Fellini](/article/en/Federico_Fellini) to [Truffaut](/article/en/François_Truffaut). The director and actor had "finally found the right tone to bring love to the screen."

Previously, under Sorrentino's direction, Servillo had portrayed Italian [Prime Ministers](/article/en/Prime_Minister_of_Italy) [Giulio Andreotti](/article/en/Giulio_Andreotti) in *[Il Divo](/article/en/Il_Divo)* (2008) and [Silvio Berlusconi](/article/en/Silvio_Berlusconi) in *[Loro – The Seduced](/article/en/Loro_(2018_film))* (2018).
