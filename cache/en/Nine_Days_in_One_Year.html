# Nine Days of One Year

*Nine Days of One Year* (Russian: Девять дней одного года, *Devyat' dney odnogo goda*) is a 1962 Soviet black-and-white drama film directed by [Mikhail Romm](/article/en/Mikhail_Romm) about nuclear physicists, their scientific work, and relationships. The film explores themes of scientific ethics, sacrifice, friendship, and love, partially based on real events in Soviet nuclear physics research. It is considered one of the most significant Soviet films of the 1960s and a key work of the [Khrushchev Thaw](/article/en/Khrushchev_Thaw) period.

According to a poll by the magazine "Soviet Screen," it was voted the best film of 1962, with lead actor [Aleksey Batalov](/article/en/Aleksey_Batalov) recognized as the best actor of the year. The film was a major commercial success, seen by approximately 24 million Soviet viewers during its theatrical run.

## Plot

The film depicts nine specific days over the course of a year in the early 1960s, focusing on the lives of nuclear physicists working at a research institute in Siberia.

### Prologue

The story begins in a small town consisting of a few streets alongside a large physics institute, where scientists engage in philosophical debates about the ethical problems of atomic energy and the effects of scientific discoveries. The most devoted among them is Dmitri Gusev, a quiet, reserved, highly gifted experimental physicist who puts himself in danger out of a sense of duty.

### The First Day (Spring)

Alarm sirens go off at the physics institute due to a reactor incident. Professor Konstantin Sintsov was attempting to create plasma and kept increasing the reactor's power until it went out of control due to a miscalculation. Since he was positioned right at the viewing port, he received a lethal radiation dose of about 600 roentgens. Despite knowing he will not survive, Sintsov is elated because he succeeded in producing fully ionized plasma.

His colleague Dmitri Gusev (nicknamed Mitya), who was standing farther away, receives about 200 roentgens. Before parting, the professor advises him to quit everything at the institute. On his way to treatment in Moscow, Mitya meets his old friend Ilya Kulikov at the airport, who is coming to see him. 

Ilya is carrying a letter from Mitya's girlfriend Lyolya, who wants to end their six-year relationship because they rarely saw each other during this time. She intends to marry Ilya instead. However, the letter never reaches Mitya.

### The Second Day (Two Months Later)

Gusev is released from the hospital. Lyolya and Ilya meet in the hospital lobby to pick him up, planning to inform him about their intention to marry. During his final consultation, doctors explicitly warn Gusev not to expose himself to radiation again as he would not survive it.

At Mitya's suggestion, they go to a restaurant to eat. During their animated conversation, Ilya fails to mention the planned wedding with Lyolya. As their discussion continues, Lyolya realizes she still loves Mitya, despite his admission that he had rarely thought about her.

After leaving the restaurant, Lyolya insists on speaking with Mitya before his flight. They meet at the Moscow telephone exchange while Ilya waits outside. Mitya reveals that he wouldn't have married her because he had already received larger doses of radiation in previous years, which nobody knows about. When Ilya checks on them, Lyolya surprises both men by announcing that she will marry Mitya and fly with him back to the institute.

### The Third Day

A bachelor party takes place with a big celebration among colleagues at the institute.

### The Fourth Day

This depicts an ordinary day in the newlyweds' life. Lyolya reflects on marriage while preparing breakfast. She wonders why everything is good when people are in love and why that changes after marriage. She sees little of her husband, who works long hours and returns home late at night.

### The Fifth Day (Spring)

Lyolya contemplates why Mitya hardly notices her anymore. When the doorbell rings, she assumes it's her husband returning, but it's Ilya, who has come to the town at Mitya's request without Lyolya's knowledge, which angers her.

At the institute, Mitya takes Ilya to see a new series of experiments but sends him to secure rooms beforehand. When Gusev exits the reactor room, colleagues inform him about the successful experiment—they have created neutrons. During the celebration at Mitya's apartment, Ilya calculates that Mitya was exposed to at least 200 more roentgens during the experiment. Mitya asks him to keep this a secret and to work at the institute in the future.

### The Sixth Day

The initial success of the experiments cannot be replicated, which worries Mitya greatly. He puts his hope in a new facility, which he shows to Ilya. When he arrives home late, Lyolya suggests he should move into the institute. During their conversation, he confesses that he was irradiated again a month ago, marking the beginning of his decline.

### The Seventh Day

Mitya returns to his parents' home in a small village that will soon be demolished because of iron ore deposits beneath it. He introduces Lyolya to his father and sisters' families. During the visit, the first signs of his illness become unmistakably visible. In conversation with his father, Mitya confirms that he's satisfied with his life. When asked whether it's worth giving one's life for atomic research, he answers with a clear "Yes, it's worth it."

### The Eighth Day

Mitya's health has deteriorated significantly, preventing him from working, but Lyolya keeps him updated on the institute's activities. Despite his condition, he makes the arduous journey to the laboratory, where he unexpectedly finds Ilya, who has been working there for two days. This agitates Mitya, especially when he learns that Lyolya brought Ilya there.

Although the experiments end in failure, they discover an interesting effect. Mitya reminds Lyolya that it's exactly one year since their conversation at the telephone exchange. He states that he is content, that it wasn't a bad year, and that he will fly to Moscow for treatment the next day, but Lyolya should not accompany him.

### The Ninth Day

In a Moscow clinic, Mitya meets the same professor who had warned him a year earlier. So far, there have only been experiments on dogs to treat radiation sickness, but Gusev insists on being the first human test subject. 

A young medical student named Mitya appears, who will donate bone marrow to keep Gusev alive. Ilya arrives, informing Mitya that the institute has decided to name the newly discovered effect after Gusev. Ilya then returns to Lyolya in the reception hall to await the operation results.

A nurse eventually brings a note from Mitya asking Ilya to get him a pair of pants so they can all go to a restaurant together, suggesting a positive outcome.

## Production

The film's working title was "365 Days." Director Mikhail Romm assembled an entirely new team of people with whom he had never previously worked.

Popular actors [Yury Yakovlev](/article/en/Yury_Yakovlev) and Aleksey Batalov were initially hired for the main roles. Just before filming began, Yakovlev was hospitalized following a car accident where he suffered a concussion and broken collarbone, and had to be replaced with [Innokenty Smoktunovsky](/article/en/Innokenty_Smoktunovsky). For the main female role, Romm cast the young and relatively unknown actress [Tatyana Lavrova](/article/en/Tatyana_Lavrova) from the [Sovremennik Theatre](/article/en/Sovremennik_Theatre). The role of Lyolya became Lavrova's best-known film role; she later primarily devoted herself to theater work.

The screenplay was written by Romm jointly with [Daniel Khrabrovitsky](/article/en/Daniel_Khrabrovitsky). The cinematographer was newcomer German Lavrov. In many respects, the film broke new ground in Soviet cinema. Critics noted its unusual approach to music and sound design—there is almost no traditional music, only technological sound accompaniment that creates atmosphere. The set design was also considered innovative.

Batalov described his interest in the role: "I worked with great interest on the character of Dmitry Gusev. The life of this atomic scientist is filled with persistent, meaningful, and completely inconspicuous heroism. The role of Gusev especially attracts me because he is a person of today, deeply intelligent, one might say - a person of new Soviet formation."

The filming took six months. The premiere took place on March 5, 1962, at the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.

Seven actors who appeared in the film were later awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR: Batalov (1976), Smoktunovsky (1974), Plotnikov (1966), Blinnikov (1963), Gerdt (1990), Evstigneev (1983), and Durov (1990). Director Mikhail Romm had been a People's Artist of the USSR since 1950.

According to Alexey Batalov, numerous darker elements conceived by the authors were removed from the film due to censorship requirements. For example, a scene where Gusev visits his mother's grave was cut, as was an indication that by the finale, his radiation sickness would lead to blindness.

## Filming Locations

The small town near Novosibirsk depicted in the film is actually [Dubna](/article/en/Dubna) and the [Joint Institute for Nuclear Research](/article/en/Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research) there, specifically Lesnaya Street.

The restaurant scene was filmed in the famous Georgian restaurant Aragvi on Tverskaya Square in Moscow.

The Moscow hospital scenes were shot at the university hospital affiliated with [Lomonosov Moscow State University](/article/en/Lomonosov_Moscow_State_University). Through the colonnade of the entrance hall, the university's famous main building is visible.

Other locations include the Moscow airport, the display window of the [GUM department store](/article/en/GUM_(department_store)), and the waiting area of the international telephone exchange.

## Historical Context and Authenticity

The Khrushchev Thaw era following the [20th Congress of the Communist Party](/article/en/20th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) was directly reflected in many works of literature and art. This period was also known for the intellectual debates between "physicists" and "lyricists" (scientists and humanists) about their respective importance to society.

The events that formed the basis of the screenplay are, to some extent, based on real incidents. The film's scientific consultant was [Igor Tamm](/article/en/Igor_Tamm), the 1958 Nobel Prize winner in Physics. [Lev Davidovich Landau](/article/en/Lev_Landau), another Nobel Prize-winning physicist, also consulted on the film. At that time, Tamm and his colleagues were working on solving similar problems with the [Tokamak](/article/en/Tokamak) fusion reactor design.

The late 1950s and early 1960s were a time of significant advancements in controlled [thermonuclear fusion](/article/en/Nuclear_fusion) research. That's when bold experiments by Soviet scientists began on the MTR installation. The case of the so-called "false neutrons" occurred at the [Kurchatov Institute](/article/en/Kurchatov_Institute) in 1952 and received wide publicity, but the controlled thermonuclear reaction that the film's hero Gusev dreamed of did not happen at that time.

The physical aspects of the fictional experiment in the film are depicted quite accurately. If such an experiment had been successful, one of the characteristics would indeed have been high neutron emission.

Some critics have drawn parallels between the film's characters and real Soviet physicists like Igor Tamm, [Oleg Lavrentyev](/article/en/Oleg_Lavrentyev), and [Andrei Sakharov](/article/en/Andrei_Sakharov), though these connections were not explicitly intended in Romm's work.

The first documented cases of fatal radiation poisoning occurred at [Los Alamos](/article/en/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory) in the United States. In August 1945, scientist [Harry Daghlian](/article/en/Harry_Daghlian) was experimenting with tungsten carbide neutron reflector material when one piece accidentally fell onto plutonium, causing a momentary massive radiation emission. [Louis Slotin](/article/en/Louis_Slotin) suffered a similar accident in May 1946.

## Themes and Reception

Film director [Karen Shakhnazarov](/article/en/Karen_Shakhnazarov) referred to Romm's work as "the most sixties film," representing a new view of reality and contemporary problems. The film's protagonists are scientists detached from worldly concerns yet portrayed as real people who love, argue, and learn.

The construction of the film as nine days spread over one year exemplified a new "plotless" film editing approach. Moving away from classical linear plot sequences, the director established a new organizing principle where scattered episodes are united by a common authorial vision.

The film caused ambiguous and sometimes sharply critical reactions even at the screenplay stage. However, the director's risk in tackling an innovative theme paid off with box office success, festival prizes, and extensive critical debate.

New York Times critic J. Hoberman, comparing Romm's work with "[On the Beach](/article/en/On_the_Beach_(1959_film))", noted the unifying motif of negative mood and doom. The film, along with works such as "[The Cranes Are Flying](/article/en/The_Cranes_Are_Flying)", "[The Unsent Letter](/article/en/The_Unsent_Letter)", and "[Hamlet](/article/en/Hamlet_(1964_film))", entered international film distribution and became a vivid illustration of the Thaw period in the USSR for foreign viewers.

Film critic G. N. Zmievskoy noted that the film "wonderfully showed the Soviet romantic perception of science."

The film strikingly countered notions that Soviet propaganda only voiced anti-nuclear weapon rhetoric in the West while suppressing such messages domestically.
