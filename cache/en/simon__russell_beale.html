## Early life and education

Beale was born on 12 January 1961 in [Penang](/article/en/Penang), [Federation of Malaya](/article/en/Federation_of_Malaya) (present-day [Malaysia](/article/en/Malaysia)), one of six children of Captain, later Lieutenant General, Sir Peter Beale and his wife Julia née Winter. His father was serving in the [Army Medical Services](/article/en/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps) at the time of his birth. From 1991 to 1994, Beale's father served as Surgeon-General of HM Armed Forces. Both of his parents were doctors, and several other members of Beale's family have successfully pursued careers in medicine.

Beale was first drawn to the performing arts when, at the age of eight, he became a chorister at [St Paul's Cathedral](/article/en/St_Paul's_Cathedral) and a pupil at the adjoining [St Paul's Cathedral School](/article/en/St_Paul's_Cathedral_School). His secondary education was undertaken at the independent [Clifton College](/article/en/Clifton_College) in [Bristol](/article/en/Bristol). His first stage performance was as Hippolyta in [A Midsummer Night's Dream](/article/en/A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream) at primary school. In the sixth form at Clifton, he also performed in [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead](/article/en/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead), a play in which he would later star at the National Theatre. According to the Russian Wikipedia version, at 14, he first appeared on stage in the role of Desdemona in a production by the "Redgrave" school theater at Clifton College.

After Clifton, he attended [Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge](/article/en/Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge), and obtained a first in English, after which he was offered a place to undertake a PhD. He pursued further studies at [Guildhall School of Music and Drama](/article/en/Guildhall_School_of_Music_and_Drama), initially training as a singer but changing to acting after a short time, and graduating in 1983.

## Career

### Early work

Beale first came to the attention of theatre-goers in the late 1980s with a series of lauded comic performances, which were on occasion extremely camp, in such plays as [The Man of Mode](/article/en/The_Man_of_Mode) by [George Etherege](/article/en/George_Etherege) and [Restoration](/article/en/Restoration_(play)) by [Edward Bond](/article/en/Edward_Bond) at the [Royal Shakespeare Company](/article/en/Royal_Shakespeare_Company) (RSC). He broadened his range in the early 1990s with moving performances as Konstantin in Chekhov's [The Seagull](/article/en/The_Seagull), as Oswald in Ibsen's [Ghosts](/article/en/Ghosts_(play)), Ferdinand in [The Duchess of Malfi](/article/en/The_Duchess_of_Malfi) and as Edgar in [King Lear](/article/en/King_Lear).

At the first annual [Ian Charleson Awards](/article/en/Ian_Charleson_Awards) in January 1991, he received a special commendation for his 1990 performances of Konstantin in The Seagull, Thersites in [Troilus and Cressida](/article/en/Troilus_and_Cressida) and [Edward II](/article/en/Edward_II_(play)) in Edward II, all at the RSC.
