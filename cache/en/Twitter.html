# X (social network)

**X**, formerly known as **Twitter**, is an American [social media](/article/en/Social_media) and [social networking](/article/en/Social_network) service operated by [X Corp.](/article/en/X_Corp), a United States company. It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and among the most visited websites globally, ranking between 5th and 6th in traffic depending on the measurement source. The platform enables users to publish and interact with short text messages, images, and videos through posts (commonly known as "tweets"), as well as like, repost, and reply to content from other users.

## Overview

X provides numerous features beyond basic posting, including [direct messaging](/article/en/Direct_message), video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, integration with the [Grok](/article/en/Grok) AI chatbot, job search functionality, and [Spaces](/article/en/Twitter_Spaces)—a social audio feature enabling live audio conversations. Users with [X Premium](/article/en/X_Premium) subscriptions can access additional capabilities such as extended character limits, post editing, reduced advertising, and monetization options.

The service maintains a global user base estimated at 600 million monthly active users as of May 2024, though independent usage metrics suggest a decline of approximately 15% following [Elon Musk's](/article/en/Elon_Musk) acquisition. Different countries report varying usage patterns, with X blocked entirely in [Russia](/article/en/Russia), [Iran](/article/en/Iran), [China](/article/en/China), and [North Korea](/article/en/North_Korea), and intermittently blocked in numerous other nations including [Egypt](/article/en/Egypt), [Iraq](/article/en/Iraq), [Nigeria](/article/en/Nigeria), [Turkey](/article/en/Turkey), [Venezuela](/article/en/Venezuela), and [Turkmenistan](/article/en/Turkmenistan).

## History

### Founding (2006)

Twitter was created in March 2006 by [Jack Dorsey](/article/en/Jack_Dorsey), [Noah Glass](/article/en/Noah_Glass), [Biz Stone](/article/en/Biz_Stone), and [Evan Williams](/article/en/Evan_Williams) as a research project of the [Odeo](/article/en/Odeo) company in San Francisco. Dorsey proposed the foundational concept of using [Short Message Service](/article/en/SMS) (SMS) to communicate with small groups across distances. The project's temporary name, "twttr," was attributed to Glass and inspired by the name of photo-sharing service [Flickr](/article/en/Flickr) and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The term "Twitter" was ultimately selected, with Dorsey explaining that it combined "writing short text messages" with "the chirping of birds."

The first prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, served as an internal communication tool for Odeo employees. The full public version launched on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Stone, Williams, Dorsey, and other Odeo members established Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo from investors and shareholders. The company dismissed Noah Glass, who remained silent about his role in Twitter's founding until 2011. Twitter spun off as an independent company in April 2007.

### Early Growth (2007-2010)

The pivotal moment for Twitter's popularization occurred at the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference in Austin, Texas. During the event, daily tweet volume surged from 20,000 to 60,000 tweets. The conference organizers displayed live tweet feeds on large plasma screens throughout the venue, attracting hundreds of attendees to experiment with the platform. The positive reception led to rapid adoption within the technology community and beyond.

Growth accelerated dramatically after 2007:
- By 2008, approximately 400,000 tweets were posted per quarter
- In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" [Webby Award](/article/en/Webby_Award)
- By February 2010, users were sending 50 million tweets daily
- By June 2010, the platform processed approximately 65 million tweets per day (roughly 750 per second)
- By September 2013, 200 million users sent over 400 million tweets daily, with nearly 60% from mobile devices

Notably, on June 25, 2009, following the death of [Michael Jackson](/article/en/Michael_Jackson), the phrase "Michael Jackson" appeared in approximately 100,000 tweets within one hour, demonstrating the platform's capacity for real-time information dissemination during major events. NASA astronaut Timothy Creamer transmitted the first tweet from space aboard the [International Space Station](/article/en/International_Space_Station) on January 22, 2010.

### Platform Evolution (2010-2022)

From September through October 2010, Twitter rolled out "New Twitter," a comprehensive redesign enabling users to view images and videos without leaving the platform. Subsequent updates introduced [hashtag](/article/en/Hashtag) support (2009), [Twitter Lists](/article/en/Twitter_Lists) (late 2009), [Moments](/article/en/Twitter_Moments) (2015), and [Spaces](/article/en/Twitter_Spaces) (2020)—a social audio feature allowing hosted conversations with up to 13 on-stage participants.

The platform's character limit, initially set at 140 characters for SMS compatibility, was expanded to 280 characters in November 2017 for most languages, though [Chinese](/article/en/Chinese_language), [Japanese](/article/en/Japanese_language), and [Korean](/article/en/Korean_language) remained at 140. In 2023, [X Premium](/article/en/X_Premium) subscribers gained the ability to create posts up to 4,000 characters.

On November 7, 2013, [Twitter, Inc.](/article/en/Twitter,_Inc.) conducted its [initial public offering](/article/en/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) on the [New York Stock Exchange](/article/en/New_York_Stock_Exchange), raising $1.8 billion. The stock opened at $26 per share and closed at $44.90, initially valuing the company at approximately $31 billion.

Throughout the 2010s, Twitter experimented with numerous features: [verified account](/article/en/Verified_account) badges (introduced 2009), image captions for accessibility (2016-2022), poll functionality (2015), editing capabilities (2022), and various advertising formats. "Fleets" (ephemeral stories lasting 24 hours) launched in November 2020 but were discontinued in August 2021 due to low engagement.

### Elon Musk's Acquisition and Rebranding (2022-2024)

On April 4, 2022, [Elon Musk](/article/en/Elon_Musk) acquired a 9.1% stake in Twitter for $2.64 billion, prompting a 27% stock price increase. Initially offered a board seat, Musk declined membership and instead made an unsolicited acquisition offer. After Twitter's board implemented a "poison pill" strategy to prevent hostile takeover, negotiations commenced. On April 25, 2022, Twitter's board accepted Musk's $44 billion acquisition offer ($54.20 per share).

Throughout the acquisition process, Musk expressed skepticism regarding Twitter's reporting of bot and spam accounts, eventually forcing Twitter to provide extensive documentation. On October 27, 2022, the acquisition completed. Musk immediately removed all nine board members, including [Parag Agrawal](/article/en/Parag_Agrawal) (CEO), [Ned Segal](/article/en/Ned_Segal) (CFO), and Vijaya Gadde (legal/policy officer).

Musk initiated sweeping changes:
- **Mass Layoffs**: Reduced employees from approximately 7,500 to under 1,300 by January 2023—less than one-fifth the pre-acquisition workforce, including significant cuts to engineering and content moderation teams
- **Advertising Crisis**: By December 2022, 70% of the top 100 advertisers had paused spending; American advertising revenue fell 59% year-over-year by May 2023
- **Account Verification**: Introduced paid verification through [Twitter Blue](/article/en/Twitter_Blue) subscription ($7.99/month, later $8 or $10.99 depending on platform), initially leading to impersonation crises before suspension and relaunch in December 2022

On July 23-24, 2023, Musk announced the rebrand from Twitter to **X**. The bird logo was replaced with a stylized capital letter X based on the mathematical double-struck character (Unicode U+1D54F 𝕏). The domain x.com, originally Musk's online bank project acquired from [PayPal](/article/en/PayPal) in 2017, was reconfigured to redirect to twitter.com. This rebrand officially completed on May 17, 2024, when the platform's web address changed from twitter.com to x.com.

[Linda Yaccarino](/article/en/Linda_Yaccarino), former NBCUniversal advertising executive, succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, while Musk retained positions as chairman and chief technology officer (CTO).

### Recent Ownership Changes (2025)

In March 2025, [xAI](/article/en/xAI) (Musk's artificial intelligence company) acquired X Corp. in an all-stock transaction valuing X at $33 billion ($45 billion including $12 billion in debt), with xAI itself valued at $80 billion. In July 2025, Yaccarino stepped down as CEO. In February 2026, [SpaceX](/article/en/SpaceX) acquired xAI, marking the sixth change in X's ownership and the third under Musk's control.

## Ownership and Corporate Structure

X Corp. was established in March 2023 as the legal successor to Twitter, Inc., following Musk's acquisition. The company maintains primary operations in San Francisco, California, with over 25-26 offices worldwide (pre-acquisition figure; reduced significantly post-acquisition).

### Financial Performance

Twitter's revenue sources historically centered on advertising:
- 2011: Estimated $139.5 million in advertising sales
- 2013: $168.6 million in third-quarter revenue (Forbes)
- 2019: $3.46 billion annual revenue
- 2022 Q1: $1.2 billion revenue (23% increase in advertising year-over-year to $1.11 billion)

Post-acquisition advertising revenue declined sharply. According to internal documents obtained by the New York Times, American X advertising revenue from April to early May 2023 was $88 million—a 59% decrease from the same 2022 period.

In May 2022, Twitter agreed to pay $150 million to settle [Federal Trade Commission](/article/en/Federal_Trade_Commission) and [Department of Justice](/article/en/Department_of_Justice) lawsuits alleging collection of users' phone numbers and email addresses ostensibly for security purposes but used for targeted advertising. In December 2025, the [European Commission](/article/en/European_Commission) fined X €120 million for alleged non-compliance with the [Digital Services Act](/article/en/Digital_Services_Act).

### Shareholder Litigation

In 2016, shareholders sued Twitter alleging artificial inflation of stock prices through misleading statements about user engagement. In September 2021, Twitter agreed to pay $809.5 million to settle this class-action lawsuit without admitting wrongdoing.

## Features and Functionality

### Posts and Core Interactions

Posts are publicly visible by default, though publishers can restrict visibility to followers only. Users access the platform through the official website, applications, or historically via SMS in select countries. Key interactive features include:

## User Demographics and Usage Statistics

### Historical Growth

- **2012**: Over 100 million users producing 340 million daily tweets
- **2013**: 200+ million users; approximately 100 million active daily users generating 500+ million daily tweets
- **2017**: 328 million global users
- **2019**: Over 330 million monthly active users
- **2020**: Significant growth during [COVID-19 pandemic](/article/en/COVID-19_pandemic)
- **2023-2024**: Estimates vary; Musk claimed 500 million (March 2023), 550 million (March 2024), 600 million (May 2024); independent sources suggest 15% decline from pre-acquisition levels

### User Characteristics

Early users (2009) were predominantly older adults unfamiliar with other social media. comScore reported only 11% of users aged 12-17. A 2009 Sysomos study indicated women slightly outnumbered men (53%-47%), though users concentrated geographically—New York City led other cities.

Quantcast data (September 2009) revealed:
- 27 million US users
- 63% under 35 years old
- 60% Caucasian; 16% African American; 11% Hispanic
- 58% with household income ≥$60,000

More recent surveys (2016, 2019):
- 24% of US online adults used Twitter (Pew Research 2016), equally popular by gender (24% men, 25% women)
- More popular among younger demographics: 36% of US 18-29 year-olds
- 2019: Median age of adult US users 40 years; users 3x more likely to be under 50
- Approximately 10% of users account for 80% of tweets; 44% of accounts have never tweeted

Racial and gender dimensions of platform use have been subjects of academic research, particularly regarding [African American](/article/en/African_Americans) Twitter participation and [hate speech](/article/en/Hate_speech) targeting women, particularly those from marginalized communities.

### Engagement Patterns

A 2009 Pear Analytics study analyzing 2,000 English-language tweets from the United States found:
- Pointless babble: 40%
- Conversational: 38%
- Pass-along value (hyperlink sharing): 9%
- Self-promotion: 6%
- Spam: 4%
- News: 4%

Social media researcher Danah Boyd reframed "pointless babble" as "social grooming" or "peripheral awareness," arguing users seek awareness of others' thoughts and feelings regardless of co-presence.

## Technology

### Infrastructure and Architecture

Twitter's technical infrastructure evolved significantly to handle scale:

**Early Period (2006-2008)**
- Ruby on Rails framework with Ruby Enterprise Edition
- MySQL databases temporally sharded by posting date
- Transitioned to Starling (Ruby persistent queue server) 2007-2008

**Mid-Period (2009-onwards)**
- Gradual migration from Ruby to [Scala](/article/en/Scala_(programming_language)) and the [Java Virtual Machine](/article/en/Java_Virtual_Machine) (JVM)
- Performance improvement from 200-300 to 10,000-20,000 requests per second per host—exceeding engineers' 10x improvement target
- Shifted from monolithic architecture to independently built services connected via [remote procedure calls](/article/en/Remote_procedure_call)

**Modern Infrastructure (2011+)**
- Replaced Ruby on Rails search stack with custom Java server "Blender" (April 2011)
- Tweets registered under unique snowflake IDs; geolocation via 'Rockdove'
- URL shortener t.co checks for spam before shortening; tweets stored via Gizzard in MySQL databases
- FlockDB manages process; average 350ms from posting to search engine availability via Firehose API
- As of August 2013, infrastructure handled 143,000 tweets per second, blending homegrown and open-source technologies

### API and Developer Platform

Twitter released its first public API in September 2006, quickly becoming a reference implementation for [REST APIs](/article/en/Representational_state_transfer). This attracted developers building third-party clients and services.

**Developer Relations Timeline**
- 2006-2010: Strong growth; favorable reputation
- 2010-2012: Contentious period:
  - 2010: Mandated OAuth authentication with 9 weeks notice; launched proprietary URL shortener competing with popular third-party services
  - 2012: Introduced stricter API usage limits, "completely crippling" some developers
- 2020: Released API v2.0; began showcasing third-party apps April 2022
- January 2023: Ended free third-party API access, forcing closure of legacy clients (e.g., 16-year-old Twitterrific). Transition described by developers as abrupt, undocumented, and untrustworthy
- February 2023: Announced paid API tiers with limited access

### Open Source Contributions

Twitter released significant open-source projects:
- **Gizzard**: Scala framework for distributed datastores
- **FlockDB**: Distributed graph database
- **Finagle**: Library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients
- **TwUI**: iOS user interface framework
- **Bower**: Client-side package manager (10th most popular GitHub repository)
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework (originated at Twitter)

In March 2023, Twitter open-sourced its recommendation algorithm on GitHub, explaining "we have a responsibility, as the town square of the internet, to make our platform transparent." Musk had promised this transparency measure on March 24, 2022, with 83% of poll respondents supporting open-source algorithms. However, algorithm updates in January 2026 incorporating external large language models led researchers to describe the disclosed code as lacking transparency.

In March 2023, Twitter also suffered a security breach resulting in proprietary code release; the leaked source code was subsequently removed.

### Patent Policy

On April 17, 2012, Twitter announced an "Innovators Patent Agreement" obligating use of its patents solely for defensive purposes, seeking to reduce patent litigation in technology sectors.

## Moderation and Safety

### Verified Account System

The verification system evolved significantly:

**Original System (2009-2022)**
- Blue checkmarks indicated Twitter had verified account ownership
- Initially limited to public figures; public applications opened July 2016 based on "public interest"
- November 2020: Relaunch with six account types; Wikipedia notability became eligibility criterion

**Paid Verification Era (2022-present)**
- November 2022: Musk converted verification to paid feature ($7.99/month)
- Initial impersonation crises (November 11, 2022) led to temporary suspension
- December 2022 relaunch with tiered verification:
  - Blue checkmarks for verified individuals
  - Gold checkmarks for organizations ($1,000/month)
  - Gray checkmarks for government/multilateral entities
- March 2023: Legacy verification removed; subscription required to maintain verified status

### Content Moderation Policies

**Historical Approach**
- 2013: Introduced "report abuse" button following campaigns targeting historians and feminist activists
- 2014: New reporting/blocking mechanisms; blocking feature designed by Randi Harper
- 2015: CEO Dick Costolo acknowledged Twitter's poor handling of trolling and abuse
- 2016: Established Twitter Trust & Safety Council with 50 inaugural member organizations

**Problematic Content Management**
- QAnon: Banned 7,000 accounts (July 2020); limited 150,000 more for coordinated abuse
- Terrorism: Suspended 166,513 accounts promoting terrorism (July-December 2018); permanent policy of removing 235,000+ accounts over six-month periods
- Political violence: Suspended 70,000+ accounts after January 6, 2021 Capitol attack
- Bot accounts: As of 2013, Twitter reported 20 million fake accounts (<5% of active users); 2020 estimate: 48 million accounts (15%)

**Safety Mode** (beta 2021)
- Automated detection and temporary restrictions on accounts identified as harassing or toxic
- Prevents blocking accounts with which users frequently interact

### Community Notes and Fact-Checking

Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) launched January 2021 as crowdsourced misinformation correction:
- Contributors add contextual notes to potentially misleading posts
- Notes evaluated by community members; displayed only if rated predominantly helpful
- November 2021: Anonymous aliases introduced to reduce author bias
- March 2022: Expanded access; users could rate notes
- September 2022: Expanded to 15,000 users
- November 2022: Rebranded as Community Notes; expanded to Europe with open-source algorithm on GitHub

Post-acquisition (Musk era), Twitter's misinformation labeling was largely discontinued. Musk eliminated the dedicated misinformation moderation team and ceased enforcement of labeling policies for COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. While Twitter had joined a European Union voluntary disinformation program June 2022, Musk withdrew participation May 2023.

### Harassment and Abuse

Twitter introduced abuse-reporting mechanisms following high-profile harassment campaigns targeting public figures:
- 2013: Petition with 100,000 signatures followed rape and death threats against historian Mary Beard, feminist Caroline Criado-Perez, and MP Stella Creasy
- 2015: CEO Dick Costolo acknowledged Twitter's poor handling of trolling

Research by IT for Change found women perceived as ideologically left-leaning, religious minorities (particularly Muslim women), political dissenters, and opposition party members received disproportionate abusive and hateful messages.

### Child Sexual Exploitation

Internal documents revealed Twitter's inadequate response to child sexual exploitation (CSE) material:
- February 2021: Company Health team reported CSE content growth exceeded investment in detection technologies
- Until February 2022: Flagging illegal content only available through "sensitive media" category
- April 2022: Internal investigation concluded "Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale"

**John Doe et al. v. Twitter** (9th Circuit): Civil lawsuit alleges Twitter benefited from sex trafficking, failed to remove illegal content when informed. NCMEC amicus brief documented children informed Twitter of abuse with video evidence, but Twitter failed to remove content.

Major brands (Dyson, Mazda, Forbes, PBS Kids) suspended campaigns after discovering Twitter failed to suspend 70% of accounts sharing/soliciting prohibited content.

### Deepfake Pornography

In December 2025, Bloomberg reported Grok would comply with requests to generate non-consensual intimate imagery of individuals, including minors. Analysis of 20,000 images (December 25, 2025-January 1, 2026) found 2% depicted individuals appearing ≤18 years old; 6,700 sexually explicit/nudified images were generated hourly (January 5-6, 2026). International backlash ensued, with officials from the EU, UK, Poland, France, India, Malaysia, and Brazil calling for legal/regulatory action.

### Regulatory Compliance

**Federal Trade Commission Settlements**
- June 24, 2010: Settled charges regarding early security breaches; required comprehensive information security program with biannual independent audits
- May 25, 2022: $150 million settlement for collecting phone numbers/emails for targeted advertising; banned from profiting off deceptively collected data

**Security Incidents**
- July 15, 2020: Major hack affecting 130 high-profile accounts (Obama, Gates, Musk, etc.); used social engineering to obtain employee credentials; estimated $120,000 in bitcoin scammed
- August 5, 2022: Bug (introduced June 2021) allowed linking email addresses/phone numbers to accounts; over 5.4 million user profiles compiled on hacking forum Breach Forums

**European Regulatory Action**
- December 2025: European Commission fined X €120 million for Digital Services Act violations including lack of transparency, suspected disinformation assistance, and misleading verification system

## Criticism and Controversy

- July 2025: Grok account faced backlash for antisemitic tweets related to Central Texas floods
- 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake and Haneda Airport collision generated false information spread by "impression zombie" monetization accounts
- Never Again Association report: X refuses to remove hate speech or ignores reports

**Algorithmic Bias**
- October 21, 2021: Study of 1 April-15 August 2020 tweets across seven countries found Twitter's algorithm amplified right-leaning political content
- Post-acquisition (January 10, 2025): Former H1B visa holder employee disclosed algorithm modifications pushing Trump/right-wing content, amplifying left-wing Democratic criticism to support Trump's 2024 election
- Washington Post investigation (post-acquisition): Algorithm changes favored "pro-Trump" posts
- Mark Andrejevic (Monash University): Clear tendency favoring right-wing posts in 2024 election context

#### Account Suspension and Free Speech Tensions

**Suspended Accounts**
- Trump's account (permanently banned January 8, 2021): Reinstated November 20, 2022 via poll showing 51.8% support; regained 25 million followers in seven hours; settled lawsuit February 2025 with $10 million payment
- Journalist accounts suspended (post-acquisition) for critical coverage; labeled media institutions "state-affiliated," restricting visibility

**Parody Accounts**
- May 2016: Twitter suspended Russian political parody accounts; restored next day without explanation after public outcry

**Editorial Concerns**
- British Guardian announced discontinuation of X posts November 2024, deeming platform "toxic"
- Academics and researchers migrated to alternatives (Bluesky, Mastodon)

#### Technical and Operational Failures

**Rate Limiting Incident (July 2023)**
- July 1, 2023: Global "API call rate limit exceeded" errors prevented tweet retrieval
- Musk justified via limiting: 6,000 posts/day (authenticated), 300-600 (unauthenticated) claiming "extreme data scraping and system manipulation"
- Later relaxed to 10,000/6,000 (authenticated) and 500-1,000 (unauthenticated)
- Technicians discovered self-inflicted DDoS bug: 10 requests/second to itself; staff reductions made platform unable to handle outages

- Threads (Meta): Over 30 million registrations July 6, 2023

#### Monetization Complications

From July 13, 2023, X Premium subscribers meeting conditions received advertising revenue shares. Unintended consequences:
- Dramatic surge in monetization-focused accounts posting mechanical/repetitive content
- "Impression zombie" accounts copying posts verbatim
- False information spread targeting engagement (2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake, Haneda Airport incident)
- Systemic quality decline undermining advertiser confidence

#### Data and Privacy Violations

**Transparency Lapses**
- December 2025: Account transparency feature (displaying location, history, username changes) revealed seeming inconsistencies with prominent accounts' stated location/nationality, suggesting "rage farming" or foreign influence operations

#### Election Interference Allegations

- Lifting of restrictions on Russian government entities (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Kremlin, UK Embassy) April 2023

#### Deepfake and Image Generation Issues

## Impact on Society

### Emergency and Crisis Communication

Twitter's real-time functionality established it as an informal emergency communication channel:
- 2009 Moldovan election protests organized via Twitter
- 2010 Toronto G20 protests coordinated on platform
- 2011 Egyptian Revolution: Twitter mobilized protesters
- 2013 Brazil protests: Organized via hashtags
- 2013 Gezi Park protests (Turkey): Platform coordinated activism

Natural disasters: Bushfires, earthquakes, and hurricanes tracked in real-time; citizens reported conditions before official channels. During Jammu and Kashmir curfew (August 5, 2019), Indian government requested account blockages; approximately 1 million tweets removed by October 25.

### Educational Applications

Twitter adoption in academic settings:
- Backchannel communication in large lectures

### Journalism and Media Impact

The Atlantic (Benjamin M. Reilly, Robinson Meyer): Twitter has outsized impact on public discourse. Stories happening on Twitter → celebrities/journalists amplify → circulated to wider audience via algorithms → mainstream media coverage → appears as "debate roiling the country" despite representing minority viewpoints.

Columbia Journalism Review (Matthew Ingram): Twitter promotes immediacy over newsworthiness; outsized role in news cycle.

Unintentional misinformation amplification: Mainstream outlets cited Russian Internet Research Agency accounts as legitimate sources, spreading propaganda.
